His explorations of the eastern coastline of Australia, leading to its eventual British colonization; his thorough charting of New Zealand, discovery of the Hawaiian Island, and his investigation of both the mythical 'Terra Incognita' in the southern ocean and the equally mythical Northwest Passage, as well as his contributions to cartography and to the cure and prevention of sea disease were all of immense scientific and political significance. Though lacking in formal education, Cook was a man of great intelligence and unbounded curiosity, and his journals reflect a wide-ranging interest in everything from island customs to specific problems of navigation, charting, command, and diplomacy.<br>This reprinting of selections from Cook's journals, edited by A. Grenfell Price, celebrates the bicentennial anniversary of his explorations. It abounds in descriptions of newly discovered plant species, particulars of coastline and land features, details of navigation, and impressions of the various Pacific peoples he encountered. Cook's was a many-faceted genius, able at once to grasp the complexities of mathematics necessary for navigation and mapping and the subtle intricacies of politics and negotiation. He often recorded his keen judgments of both subordinates and native chieftains and priests in a way that displays his own great spirit and humanity. Always solicitous of the health of his crewmen, he took great pains to insure proper diet and conditions of cleanliness, and he carefully described these measures in his journal. His tragic death at the hands of Hawaiian islanders is fully rendered from eyewitness accounts, and the implications of his discoveries to the expansion of scientific knowledge are clearly presented by the editor.<br>Although Cook's journals will prove of inestimable value to historians, anthropologists, and students of the history of science, they can be enjoyed equally as lively narratives of high adventure and discovery. Any sympathetically roving imagination will take unbounded delight in this great classic of exploration by a most "curious and restless son of Earth."</p><p></p><h2>Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know: The Extraordinary Exploits of the British and European Aristocracy</h2><p><p>The alarming history of the British, and European, aristocracy - from Argyll to Wellington and from Byron to Tolstoy, stories of madness, murder, misery, greed and profligacy.</p><p>From Regency playhouses, to which young noblemen would go simply in order to insult someone to provoke a duel that might further their reputation, to the fashionable gambling clubs or 'hells' which were springing up around St James's in the mid-eighteenth century, the often bizarre doings of aristocrats. </p><p>An eighteenth-century English gentleman was required to have what was known as 'bottom', a shipping metaphor that referred to stability. Taking part in a duel was a bold statement that you had bottom. William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne certainly had bottom, if not a complete set of gonads following his duel with Colonel Fullarton, MP for Plympton. Both men missed with their first shots, but the colonel fired again and shot off Shelborne's right testicle. Despite being hit, Shelborne deliberately discharged his second shot in the air. When asked how he was, the injured Earl coolly observed his wound and said, 'I don't think Lady Shelborne will be the worse for it.' </p><p>The cast of characters includes imperious, hard-drinking and highly volatile Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who is remembered today as much for his brilliant scientific career as his talent for getting involved in bizarre mishaps, such as his death as a result of his burst bladder; the Marquess of Queensberry, a side-whiskered psychopath, who, on a luxury steamboat in Brazil, in a row with a fellow passenger over the difference between emus and ostriches, and knocked him out cold; and Thomas, 2nd Baron Lyttelton, a Georgian rake straight out of central casting, who ran up enormous gambling debts, fought duels, frequented brothels and succumbed to drug and alcohol addiction.</p><p>Often, such rakes would be swiftly packed off on a Grand Tour in the hope that travel would bring about maturity. It seldom did.</p></p><p>Karl Shaw has worked as a journalist, in advertising and in marketing.

The rider pedaled slowly, obviously enjoying a sunset outing, admiring the silvery glow of the chalky gray strand, the creamy gold of the gently waving sea oats on their wind-sculpted dunes. Every so often a weathered gray boardwalk provided access from the beach to the homes hidden behind the dunes. But the rider was oblivious to the tangy salt scent and silken caress of the breeze now flowing back to sea as the sun set. Instead, it was the emptiness of the scene that pleased, for no one moved on this stretch of Broward&#x2019;s Rock beach so far as the eye could see.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, the first objective had been met, an unobserved approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the next boardwalk, the rider dismounted and dropped the bicycle on its side. The scuff of sneakers against the sand-filmed wooden slats couldn&#x2019;t be heard over the rustle of the breeze through the sea oats. It took not quite thirty seconds to reach the patio behind the Buckners&#x2019; rambling beachfront house. A pink-and-yellow plastic sea horse rocked in the shamrock-shaped pool. Blue terry-cloth beach towels hung from webbed chairs. A Fortune magazine fluttered on a cane table, held in place by carelessly dropped, salt-rimmed goggles.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sandy? Dick?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The call hung unanswered in the hush of twilight.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bicyclist stepped over a furled beach umbrella, called out again, and knocked sharply on the French doors, but, just as expected, no answer came. The Buckners were not at home. There was always noise, motion, confusion, and disarray when Dick and Sandy were there.<br> &nbsp;<br> A warm flush of anticipation suffused the bicyclist. And when the door, unlocked, swung in, there was a sharp, heady sense of triumph. Of course, Dick and Sandy left their doors unlocked. They were careless, messy, and heedless.<br> &nbsp;<br> The den smelled of pipe smoke and an odd combination of dried newsprint and paints from Sandy&#x2019;s collages. The Sunday papers littered the floor. Across the room the last shafts from the setting sun glittered on the glass panes of the gun case.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, crumpled gardening gloves were pulled from a jacket pocket and donned. A gloved hand twisted the handle.<br> &nbsp;<br> An ugly twist of sheer fury flamed for an instant.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hand rattled the handle. Locked. Locked!<br> &nbsp;<br> But they were so careless, so idiotically undisciplined.... The haze of anger cleared, cold analytical thought returned, the gloved hand swept above the case, and a key clattered to the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Less than a minute later, the bicyclist rode off into the dusk. Two target pistols in a capacious carryall thudded against the right leg as the rider pumped, a solitary figure against the dusky sky, enjoying the solitude of an evening outing on the beach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> Shane shifted the tiller, and the wind kicked into the sails. Sweet Lady surged ahead. He savored the heavy heat of the noon sun, the beading of water against his bronzed skin. He glanced down at the matted golden hair on his chest. By God, he still had the body women lusted for. He ignored the puffy softness of his belly and admired his trunk-thick legs. He recalled the quick glance of interest from that dark-haired girl on the Dancing Cat. Maybe he&#x2019;d ask her over for a drink when he got back. He liked the look of her legs, long and slim, and a soft little butt. The familiar heat coursed in his crotch. Then he remembered. Shit. Another rehearsal. But only a few more days and all that would be over. He would be free. Free of this stuffy, boring island. Free of Sheridan. His shoulders hunched. Sheridan kept badgering him to learn his lines. Said it would look better. Hell, what difference did it make? God, he&#x2019;d be glad to see the last of Sheridan, go his own way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only a few more days.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 3<br> &nbsp;<br> Carla knew the room was a perfect backdrop for her: the muted bone of the linen-sheathed sofa and chairs, austere yet luxurious; the woven cotton rug with alternating diamonds of rust and brown, cobalt and moss green; the crystal clarity of the glass coffee table with its gleaming beveled edges. She moved through the open doors and stepped out onto the balcony overlooking the sound. Moonlight swept over her. She glanced down at her soft satin trousers. Turning, she slowly looked back into the living room and the mirrored wall opposite. Her reflection shimmered in the moonlight&#x2014;jade green silk jacket, ivory trousers. She saw an apparition from long ago, cheeks faintly flushed, long ebony hair hanging straight and still. God, she hadn&#x2019;t looked like this since&nbsp;...&nbsp;Her mind veered away, but the pain that slumbered in her marrow flared, and she felt a moment&#x2019;s panic. She&#x2019;d sworn that it would never happen again. Never. It hurt too much.<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced at the crystal goblets waiting on the jewellike table for the finest, lightest white wine, the best she could offer. And after wine, after conversation, words with long pauses and longer glances, she knew what would happen. A touch, a caress, and the explosion of passion that hurt and destroyed but transformed.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet, she knew&#x2014;in her heart&#x2014;she knew how it would end. But she was so tired of loneliness and the shell she had built to keep out the world. So tired. So hungry to be touched.<br> &nbsp;<br> The front doorbell rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carla glanced once more at her own loveliness, then&#x2014;her face uncertain, her eyes clouded with yearning&#x2014;she moved toward the door.</p><h2>Fireproof: A Maggie O&#39;Dell Mystery (Special Agent Maggie O&#39;Dell Series)</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Alex Kava returns in a blaze of glory with a gripping, action-packed thriller featuring special agent Maggie O'Dell,who is leading the search for a serial arsonist whose crimes threaten Maggie dangerously close to home.<br><br>When a building bursts into flames on a cold winter night in D.C., investigators see a resemblance to a string of recent fires in the area.

Out here on the outskirts of warehouseland it was quiet. Nobody hassled you. But it got boring as hell. Cornell would make a trip downtown at least once a week. Pick up some fresh cigarette butts, do a little panhandling. Sometimes he&#x2019;d sit in the library and read. He couldn&#x2019;t check out any books. Where the hell would he keep them? What if he didn&#x2019;t get them back on time? In this new life he didn&#x2019;t want even that little bit of obligation or responsibility. Those were the pitfalls that had landed him on the streets in the first place.<br><br>So once a week he&#x2019;d leave his prized possessions&#x2014;�the box, a couple of blankets someone had mistakenly tossed in a Dumpster. He&#x2019;d put his few small valuables in a dirty red backpack and lug it around for the day. If he didn&#x2019;t want to walk the five miles he&#x2019;d have to get up early to catch the homeless bus. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d done this morning. But he missed the last evening bus. He didn&#x2019;t bother to keep track of time anymore.<br><br>What did it matter? Not like he had a meeting or appointment. Hell, he didn&#x2019;t even wear a watch. Truth was, his gold-plated Rolex had been one of the first things he&#x2019;d pawned. But today Cornell ran into a bit of luck. Actually sort of tripped right in front of it when a black town car almost knocked him into the curb.<br><br>The car was picking up some woman and her stiff, both all dressed up, probably on their way to the Kennedy Center or a cocktail party. The woman started to apologize, then elbowed her old man until he dug into his wallet. Cornell didn&#x2019;t pay much attention and instead found himself wondering how all these gorgeous young women ended up with these old geezers.<br><br>Never mind. He knew exactly how.<br><br>A few years ago he would have been competition for this bastard. Now he was a nuisance to take pity on. Although Cornell convinced himself that the woman had caught a glimpse of his irresistible charm. Yeah, charming the way he picked himself up from the sidewalk, smack-�dab between the curb and the car&#x2019;s bumper. Lucky he hadn&#x2019;t pissed himself. He could still feel the heat of the engine.<br><br>But the woman&#x2014;�she was something. There was eye contact between them. Yeah, she definitely made eye contact. Then a hint of a smile and even a slight blush when Cornell licked his lips at her while her escort wasn&#x2019;t looking. The guy had ducked his bald head to rifle through his wallet. Bastard was probably sorry now that he didn&#x2019;t have anything less than fifty-�dollar bills.<br><br>In Cornell&#x2019;s mind that smile, that blush, screamed to him that in another place, another time, she&#x2019;d gladly be giving him something more than her boyfriend&#x2019;s cash. And he took heart in their secret transaction, restoring a small piece of something he had lost but didn&#x2019;t miss until someone like this gorgeous woman reminded him that he wasn&#x2019;t who he used to be. Not only who he used to be, but now little more than garbage to be kicked or shoved to the curb. A small piece of him hated her for that, but he did appreciate the hell out of the fifty bucks.<br><br>It was more than he&#x2019;d seen all month. And as if to prove to her, to prove to himself, that beneath the grime and sweat stains he was still that other person who could be charming and witty and smart, Cornell broke the fifty at a corner diner. He even sat at the counter, ordered soup and a grilled cheese. When he paid the bill he asked for ones. The waitress did a double take, turning the fifty over, her eyes narrowing as she examined the bill and then his face.<br><br>Cornell just smiled when she finally handed him his change. He folded and stuffed the ones carefully into the side pocket of his threadbare cargo pants, pleased that the button still closed solid and safe over his new stash.<br><br>When his food came&#x2014;�soup steaming, melted cheese oozing onto white porcelain&#x2014;�he sat paralyzed, staring at it. He hadn&#x2019;t seen anything quite so beautiful in a long time. There was a package of cute little crackers and a slice of pickle, utensils wrapped in a crisp white napkin. A cloth napkin. All of it seemed so foreign and for a minute Cornell couldn&#x2019;t remember what he was supposed to do with real utensils rather than the plasticware they gave you in the soup kitchens.<br><br>He resisted looking around. Dishes clanked, voices hummed, machines wheezed on and off, chairs scraped the linoleum. The place was busy, yet Cornell could feel eyes checking him out.<br><br>He tugged the napkin open, laid the utensils one by one on the counter, and draped the cloth over his lap. He ignored the stares, pretending that the stink of body odor wasn&#x2019;t coming from him. He tried to keep his appearance as clean as possible, even making a monthly trip to a Laundromat, but getting a shower was a challenge.<br><br>Finally Cornell picked up the soup spoon, stopping his eyes from darting around for direction. He let his fingers remember. Slowed himself down and ate, painfully conscious of every movement so that he didn&#x2019;t dribble, smack, wipe, or slurp.<br><br>Now, as he made his long way back to his cardboard home, he took guarded sips from the brand-�new bottle. The food, though delicious, had upset his stomach. The whiskey would help. It always did; an instant cure-�all for just about anything he didn&#x2019;t want to feel or remember or be. Tonight it sped up the long walk and even helped warm him as the night chill set in.<br><br>Cornell had barely turned the corner into the alley when he noticed something was wrong. The air smelled different. Rancid, but not day-�old garbage. And tinged with something burned.<br><br>No, not burned, smoking.<br><br>His nostrils twitched. There were no restaurants nearby. The brick building he kept his shelter against had been empty. It was quiet here. That&#x2019;s all he cared about and usually the Dumpster didn&#x2019;t overflow or stink. All important factors in his decision to take up residency here in the alley, his Maytag box sandwiched between the wall of the brick building and the monster green Dumpster.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when Cornell realized he couldn&#x2019;t see his cardboard box. Though hidden, a flap usually stuck out no matter how carefully he tucked it. A sudden panic twisted his stomach. He clenched the bottle tight in his fist and hurried. He hadn&#x2019;t had that much to drink yet, but his steps were staggered and his head dizzy. The only two blankets he owned were in that box, along with an assortment of other treasures tucked between folds, stuff he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to lug inside his backpack.<br><br>As he walked closer, the smell got stronger. Something sour and metallic but also something else. Like lighter fluid. Had someone started a fire to keep warm?<br><br>They sure as hell better not have used his box for kindling.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when he saw a flap of cardboard and a flood of relief washed over him in a cold sweat. The box was still there. It had been shoved deeper behind the Dumpster. The box, however, wasn&#x2019;t empty.<br><br>Son of a bitch!<br><br>Cornell couldn&#x2019;t believe his eyes. Some bastard lay sprawled inside his home, feet sticking out. Looked like a pile of old, ragged clothes if it weren&#x2019;t for those two bare feet.<br><br>He took a long gulp of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s. Screwed the cap back on, nice and tight, and set the bottle down safe against the brick wall. Then Cornell pushed up his sleeves to his elbows and stomped the rest of the way.<br><br>Nobody was taking his frickin&#x2019; home away from him.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you,&#x201d; he yelled as he grabbed the ankles. &#x201c;Get the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>Cornell let his anger drive him as he twisted and yanked and pulled. But he was surprised it didn&#x2019;t take much effort. Nor was there any resistance. He didn&#x2019;t stop though, dragging the body away from the container, letting the intruder&#x2019;s tangled hair sweep across the filthy pavement. Before he released the ankles he gave one last shove, flipping the person over.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when Cornell saw why there had been no resistance.<br><br>He felt the acid rise from his stomach. He stumbled backward, tripping over his feet, scrambling then kicking, gasping and retching at what he saw.<br><br>The face was gone, a bloody pulp of flesh and bones. Raw jagged holes replaced an eye and the mouth. Matted hair stuck to the mess.<br><br>Cornell pushed to his knees just as the soup and grilled cheese came up his throat in a stinging froth mixed with whiskey. He tried to stand but his legs wobbled and sent him back down to the pavement right in the middle of his vomit. His eyes burned and blurred but he couldn&#x2019;t pull them away from the mangled mess just a few feet away from him.<br><br>In his panic he hardly noticed the smoke filling the alley. He tried to wipe himself off and saw that it wasn&#x2019;t just his vomit he&#x2019;d fallen into. A slick stain trailed into the alley, as if someone had accidentally leaked a line of liquid all the way to the Dumpster.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when he realized the slick stain that now covered his knees and hands was gasoline. He looked up and saw a man at the entrance to the alley, pouring from a gallon can. Cornell slipped and jerked to his feet just as the guy noticed him. But instead of being startled or angry or panicked, the man did the last thing Cornell expected. He smiled and then he lit a match.</p><h2>Avalanche: Heretical Reflections on the Dark and the Light</h2><p>In his powerful bestselling book Joy's Way, Dr. W. Brugh Joy shared the story of the spiritual transformation that led him to abandon his medical practice and indeed his whole way of life. In the ten years since, Dr. Joy has experienced the dramatic second stage of his spiritual evolution and Avalanche is the result. In this iconoclastic book, Dr. Joy challenges the idealistic vision of spirituality as an experience of love, light, and harmony. He dares to appreciate the dark, shadow side of human nature that, if left unintegrated, can wreak havoc in our lives.<br><br>In fact, Dr. Joy sees shadow work as essential for the evolution of consciousness. He explores the dynamic of the shadow in such issues as multiple personalities as the basis of self, the collapse of exclusively masculine spiritual values, the emergence of the divine feminine and the counter forces that are set in motion in backlash against it, the power of destruction as a purging and healing force, and the battle of the individual with the collective. To access our hidden dark side, Dr. Joy offers as tools dreamwork, archetypes, rituals, and rites of passage, which can set the stage for transformation. Sure to generate controversy, Avalanche demands -- and rewards -- readers who are willing to experience their own deep psyche.</p><p>"Attempts to consciously grapple with the 'dark side' of life...Avalanche reflects a sophisticated and challenging psycho-spiritual perspective, one well worth digesting."<p>Gnosis Magazine</p><p></p><p>"Interesting and provocative...This is a unique book, and I appreciate the many insights it offers."</p><p>Stanley Krippner, Ph.

No specific chess knowledge is needed, but after reading <em>Every Move Must Have a Purpose</em>, you will share with the most astute chess players the secret to thinking on your feet.<br><br>From the celebrated 'chairman of the board' comes the secrets of strategy that everyone will find useful, including:<br><br> <ul> <li>Be aggressive, but don't take unnecessary chances </li><li>Answer all threats with a counterthreat </li><li>When exchanging, always get at least as much as you give up</li></ul>Crisply and engagingly written, with entertaining examples and chess anecdotes, <em>Every Move Must Have a Purpose</em> will improve your strategic thinking so you'll never again debate your next move.</p><p><strong>Bruce Pandolfini</strong> is one of the world's most sought-after chess teachers and one of the most widely read chess writers working today. His role as analyst for PBS's coverage of the 1972 match between chess superstars Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky first launched him into the public eye. His coaching of chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin was portrayed in the book and film <em>Searching for Bobby Fischer</em>. He is a regular columnist for <em>Chess Life</em>, the bible of the chess world, and continues to coach young players professionally and to consult with CEOs from numerous Fortune 500 companies. He lives in New York City.Renowned chess teacher and Fortune 500 business consultant Pandolfini delves into the relation between chess and business at great length. Businesspeople love to checkmate the competition and delight in the day-to-day chess-like analysis and warfare that business demands. The author generously doles out chess anecdotes, albeit fascinating ones, yet shortchanges the listener a bit when it comes to actual business instruction; the stories are interesting, but we come away from his New Jersey-inflected lecture with more chess lore and less usable business advice than we would expect. Chess hounds will trade a queen or play at a handicap to gather the "lore of the board" contained herein, but businesspeople may want to play a few rounds before listening.

Using time-tested techniques, decorative stencil painting can be applied to every room in the house. With plant and flower patterns for the kitchen, formal ornaments for the living room, animals and bugs for the family room, children and ducks for the nursery, and sea life for the bathroom, they can also be mixed and matched to suit a particular taste and decor. This treasure trove of Arts &amp; Crafts stencil patterns is based on articles originally published in The Journal of Decorative Art. When W. G. Sutherland first published this book back in 1910, it was intended for the professional decorator. But today's do-it-yourselfer has skills that far surpass the imagination of Mr. Sutherland in the early twentieth century. Turn-of-the-century methods are described thoroughly and give an excellent background in the art of stencilling for ornamental detail. In addition to discussing supplies and preparations, Sutherland shares trade secrets for managing corners, applying continuous borders and friezes, and working up ceiling treatments and "all over" patterns-all the while working efficiently and quickly. Arts &amp; Crafts Stencilling is the perfect companion for a bungalow update or for a contemporary Arts &amp; Crafts-style home. W. G.

It begins with the colonization of the Alps by Romanized Celtic peoples who came from the plain to clear the wilderness, establish a tiny monastic house, and create a dairy economy that became famous for its cheeses. Over ten centuries the village, like the rest of Switzerland, went through the traumas of religious reformation and political revolution. A single currency, a unified postal service, and eventually an integrated army brought improved stability and prosperity to the union of two dozen small republics.<br><br>Yet Switzerland's enduring foundation remains the three thousand boroughs to which the Swiss people feel they truly belong. In <i><b>Switzerland: A Village History</b></i>, distinguished scholar David Birmingham tells the story of his childhood village-Ch�teau-d'Oex-where records of cheesemaking date to 1328. The evolution of this ancient grazing and forest economy included the rise of the legal profession to keep track of complex deeds, grazing allotments, and animal rights-of-way. Switzerland's eventual privatization of communal grazing land drove many highlanders to emigrate to the European plains and overseas to the Americas. The twentieth century brought wealth from foreign tourism to Switzerland, punctuated by austerities imposed by Europe's wars. Alpine peasants were integrated into Swiss union society and began at last to share in some of the prosperity flowing from urban industry.<br><br><b><i>Switzerland: A Village History</i></b> replaces the mythology and patriotic propaganda that too often have passed for Swiss history with a rigorous, insightful, and charming account of the daily life, small-scale rivalries, and local loyalties that actually make up Swiss history.</p><p><b>David Birmingham</b> lived in Switzerland from 1947 to 1954 as a child and returned there in the 1990s as a visiting historian. From 1980 to 2001 he held the chair of Modern History in the University of Kent at Canterbury in England. He is the author of many books, including <i>Portugal and Africa</i>.&#x201c;An enthralling picture of the locality in its broader Swiss and international context.

In this critical rethinking of the categories of politics within a new sociopolitical and historical context, the distinguished political philosopher Giorgio Agamben builds on his previous work to address the status and nature of politics itself. Bringing politics face-to-face with its own failures of consciousness and consequence, Agamben frames his analysis in terms of clear contemporary relevance. He proposes, in his characteristically allusive and intriguing way, a politics of gesture&#x2014;a politics of means without end.Among the topics Agamben takes up are the "properly" political paradigms of experience, as well as those generally not viewed as political. He begins by elaborating work on biopower begun by Foucault, returning the natural life of humans to the center of the polis and considering it as the very basis for politics. He then considers subjects such as the state of exception (the temporary suspension of the juridical order); the concentration camp (a zone of indifference between public and private and, at the same time, the secret matrix of the political space in which we live); the refugee, who, breaking the bond between the human and the citizen, moves from marginal status to the center of the crisis of the modern nation-state; and the sphere of pure means or gestures (those gestures that, remaining nothing more than means, liberate themselves from any relation to ends) as the proper sphere of politics. Attentive to the urgent demands of the political moment, as well as to the bankruptcy of political discourse, Agamben&#x2019;s work brings politics back to life, and life back to politics.Giorgio Agamben teaches philosophy at the Coll�ge International de Philosophie in Paris and at the University of Macerata in Italy. He is the author of Language and Death (1991), Stanzas (1992), and The Coming Community (1993), all published by the University of Minnesota Press.</p><p></p><h2>High Performance Thinking for Business, Sports, and Life</h2><p>This book presents an empowering and theoreticlly sound framework for understanding and correcting what is keeping you from doing your best in business, sport, and life. High Performance Thinking (1)helps you identify your default settings for responding to performance situations; (2)teaches you how to analyze the quality of those reponses; and (3)discusses ways to improve those that are less productive than you want them to be. HIgh Performance Thinking, using sport psychology techniques, is a must read for all, regardless of age, background, or life experience.</p><p>In the twenty years that I&#39;ve been working in sports psychology, the field has undergone a major transformation. The current acceptance of sports psychology is a welcome change from the early days when it was considered a questionable, perhaps frivolous, waste of an athlete&#39;s time. Indeed, USA Today (August 1996) states that sports psychology - learning how to think and behave in ways that enhance one&#39;s physical skill - is &#34;being heralded by athletes as the performance revolution of the 1990s&#34;. I quickly realized that what was good for a sport was also good for other aspects of life. Though designed for athletes preparing for competition sports psychology techniques can be readily applied to any aspect of life by anyone who recognizes a need and has a desire for self-improvement. The key is that what we think is as important as what we do. By consistently combining mental skills with physical skills, anyone can improve their performance, whether that performance is at a board meeting or on the playing field, at the PTA or the PGA.Gayle A. Davis, a psychologist, is nationally and inter- nationallly recognized for her seminars on personal growth and performance in life, sports, and business. In addition to her clinical practice in Colorado Springs, Dr. DAvis has worked for over twenty years in sports psychology. She is well respected for her work with all levels of athletes and coaches, including World Class and Olympic contenders.</p><h2>Mind Control 101 - How To Influence The Thoughts And Actions Of Others Without Them Knowing Or Caring</h2><p>Why would someone write a book on Mind Control? Because as much as we try to elevate ourselves above being human animals we are, in fact, animals. We are subject to the wants and desires of any being with a genome and vertebrae. To rise above that is an admirable and a task we should take on as a worthy spiritual endeavor. But to deny that we are, truly, animals is to lie to ourselves. We must deal with people who may not be so enlightened advanced as we are. They may desire what we have and be secretly filled with envy and contempt. The worst event is to have these suspicions fulfilled and then be pulled down into the politics of man. Do we deny that it&#39;s happening and hope others will be touched by our honesty and good will enough to change? Or do we drop our highest spiritual ideals and play their game? I would like to suggest a radically different strategy. Take the game of manipulation and Mind Control and make it a part of your spirituality.</p><p></p><h2>Augustine: City of God, Volume III, Books 8-11 (Loeb Classical Library No. 413)</h2><p><p>Augustinus (354&#x2013;430 CE), son of a pagan, Patricius of Tagaste in North Africa, and his Christian wife Monica, while studying in Africa to become a rhetorician, plunged into a turmoil of philosophical and psychological doubts in search of truth, joining for a time the Manichaean society. He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals.</p><p>From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the <i>Confessions</i> (in two volumes); <i>On the City of God</i> (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of <i>Letters</i> which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.</p></p><p>Augustine was born in AD 354. He lived a wild, self-destructive life as a young man in Italy and was the subject of many prayers by his worried mother, Monica. After a life-changing conversion, he lived on to become a tremendous influence on Christian thinking.

This theory, once popular in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries, has been rejected by many modern-day creationists as being without biblical or scientific support. This book takes an in-depth look at both science and the Bible. Its purpose is to show how the Gap Theory better fits the scientific and biblical facts. More importantly, its main purpose is to reach out to unbelievers who think the Bible teaches things contrary to science. True scientific facts and true Biblical truths do not contradict. The basic assumption of the author is that God is smart enough and powerful enough and sovereign enough to make His Works and His Words agree. Because God reveals His invisible attributes in His handiwork, the author uses both God&#39;s Word and His work to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Dr. Steven Dill, once a staunch evolutionist, began investigating creationism after becoming aware of some scientific facts that seemed incompatible with his own beliefs. Taking the position that truth will stand the test, he began challenging even his own ideas about the origin of the universe. His conclusion was that true scientific facts and true Biblical truths do not contradict, and in this book he presents a new look at an old theory that preserves the integrity of both science and the Bible. He earned his Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Biology in 1979 and his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 1985 at the University of Missouri-Columbia. He is currently a practicing veterinarian in Jeffersontown, Kentucky where he lives with his wife, Linda, and two dogs, Samwise Gamgee and Rosie Cotton. His two sons, Tom and James, have grown into fine young Christian men who make their parents proud.</p><p></p><h2>The Image: Knowledge in Life and Society (Ann Arbor Paperbacks)</h2><p>Boulding discusses the image as the key to understanding society and human behavior</p><p></p><h2>Ray</h2><p>Nominated for the American Book Award, Ray is the bizarre, hilarious, and consistently adventurous story of a life on the edge.

Psychologically, this means that the living presence of the Self animates the Psalms, which therefore have the power to constellate the archetype of the God-image in those individuals who are receptive to their influence. Even many self-professed irreligious people have been astonished to discover that certain Psalms were the only texts that spoke to their condition during a period of grave psychic upheaval. <p>Today, traditional Judeo-Christianity is at a crucial turning point. But the poetry of the Psalms still rewards the effort to understand and relate their message to individual, contemporary, psychological experience. Originally a lecture series, The Sacred Psyche resonates with Dr. Edinger's heartfelt, deeply honest responses to these powerful texts.</p></p><p></p><h2>Primary Sources for Ancient History: Volume II: The Roman World</h2><p>SUPERANNO A comprehensive collection of primary sources covers the millennia-long history of the Roman World.

But the excavations on her new cabin unearth a decades-old skeleton entombed in a crumbling basement wall -- along with a butterfly pendant necklace worn by the alleged victim of a brutal serial slayer who preyed on area women twenty years earlier.</p><p>Pulled once more into a murder investigation against her will, Jessie fears a grim, half-forgotten nightmare has been reborn. For, in this stark and lonely place, in the first days of the all-too-brief Alaskan summer, another woman has disappeared without a trace. The signs suggest the unthinkable: an insatiable human monster has returned. And the clues she's uncovering hint that Jessie Arnold may well be his next victim.</p></p><p><p>Sue Henry, whose award-winning Alaska mysteries have received the highest praise from readers and critics alike, has lived in Alaska for almost thirty years, and brings history, Alaskan lore, and the majestic beauty of the vast landscape to her mysteries. Based in Anchorage, she is currently at work on the next book in this series.</p>Alaskan musher Jessie Arnold has certainly used up more than nine lives even before the start of this ninth solid adventure in a series that has won both Anthony and Macavity awards. Fiercely independent and self-reliant to a fault, Jessie must confront inner fears as well as outside dangers as she sets about rebuilding her home (gutted in 2000's Beneath the Ashes) and restructuring her life (after a breakup that occurred in the same novel). First a skeleton turns up in the excavation of her new cabin site; then a possible link is found to murders committed decades earlier by Alaska's most notorious serial killer, Robert Hansen. Hansen's victims, some of whom were never found, had been buried along the nearby Knik River. Soon not only the cabin construction crew but forensic and police investigators, plus a relative of one of Hansen's victims still searching for answers, are prowling the wild and remote Knik Road that leads to Jesse's property. As murders new and old begin to unfold, Jesse has to learn to rely on others as well as on her own substantial survival skills to surmount human and natural pitfalls. One of the hallmarks of Henry's series is the beautiful and rugged Alaskan landscape, and she has never used it more effectively than she does here, as spring sets in motion new discoveries. And Jesse's continuing voyage of self-discovery should thrill old fans as well as expand her growing audience in the lower 48.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Last Chance Knit &amp; Stitch</h2><p><strong>"Last Chance captures the essence of Southern charm and quirkiness.

He lives in Bournemouth, England.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>New York City :&nbsp;Three Months&nbsp;Later&nbsp;<br><br>The lights of Manhattan shone like constellations of&nbsp;precision-aligned stars against the night sky. Eddie&nbsp;Chase gazed out at the spectacular panorama and&nbsp;sighed. He would much rather have been somewhere,&nbsp;anywhere, on the island&#x2014;a restaurant, a bar, even a&nbsp;launderette&#x2014;than here.&nbsp;<br><br>Not that the venue itself was a problem. The <i>Ocean&nbsp;Emperor </i>was their host&#x2019;s pride and joy, a 350-foot motor&nbsp;cruiser on which absolutely no expense had been spared.&nbsp;Chase had been on luxury yachts before, but this one&nbsp;represented a whole new level of opulence. Had he just&nbsp;been with Nina and a group of close friends, he would&nbsp;have taken full advantage of the experience.&nbsp;<br><br>But apart from a handful of senior IHA staff, so far he&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t know any of the hundred-plus guests. And he&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t have anything in common with them either.&nbsp;Diplomats, politicians, titans of industry, all busy networking&nbsp;and deal-making with every handshake. Chase,&nbsp;on the other hand, was here merely as Nina&#x2019;s &#x201c;and&nbsp;guest.&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t his world.&nbsp;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t Nina&#x2019;s either, but she was doing everything&nbsp;she could to pretend it was, he thought with a frown. He&nbsp;knocked back the remaining red wine in his glass and&nbsp;turned away from the vista to face the crowd. Nina was&nbsp;standing with former U.S. Navy admiral turned historian&nbsp;Hector Amoros, the head of the IHA, and shaking&nbsp;hands with a tall, distinguished yet smug-looking man.&nbsp;<i>Politician, </i>Chase knew at a glance.&nbsp;<br><br>Nina glanced through the open doors in his direction.&nbsp;&#x201c;Eddie!&#x201d; she called, waving one hand to summon&nbsp;him. The champagne glass that had been in her other&nbsp;hand from practically the moment she boarded the&nbsp;yacht had been refilled again, he noticed. &#x201c;Eddie, come&nbsp;here and meet the senator.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, coming,&#x201d; he replied without enthusiasm, fingering&nbsp;his stiff and uncomfortable collar. A blast of noise&nbsp;and wind swept over the deck as he reentered the ship,&nbsp;another helicopter coming in to drop off more ultra-VIP&nbsp;guests on the yacht&#x2019;s helipad. Chase and Nina had been&nbsp;brought to the <i>Ocean Emperor </i>by boat, as had most of the&nbsp;other guests. Even in the world of the superrich, there&nbsp;was still a pecking order. He imagined the only way to&nbsp;top arriving by helicopter would be to land in a Harrier&nbsp;jump jet.&nbsp;<br><br>Nina looked amazing tonight, he had to admit. The&nbsp;sweeping scarlet off-the-shoulder dress was a world&nbsp;away from the ruggedly practical clothes she had worn&nbsp;when he first got to know her a year and a half before, or&nbsp;even the Italian suits she&#x2019;d adopted more recently in her&nbsp;role as the IHA&#x2019;s director of operations. Her normally&nbsp;red hair had been dyed a richer, darker tone for the occasion,&nbsp;swept and styled to highlight her carefully&nbsp;made-up face.&nbsp;<br><br>Chase ground his teeth at the mere thought of her&nbsp;hair. He&#x2019;d complained about it all day before Nina finally&nbsp;made him promise to shut up.&nbsp;<br><br>But still . . . <i>five hundred dollars </i>for a fucking <i>haircut</i>?&nbsp;&#x201c;Eddie,&#x201d; said Nina, &#x201c;this is Senator Victor Dalton.&nbsp;Senator, this is Eddie Chase, who works for me at the&nbsp;IHA. And he also happens to be my boyfriend,&#x201d; she&nbsp;added.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice to meet you, Senator,&#x201d; said Chase, shooting&nbsp;Nina a subtly annoyed look as he shook Dalton&#x2019;s hand.&nbsp;He recognized the name&#x2014;Dalton was in the running to&nbsp;be the next president of the United States. That explained&nbsp;the two stone-faced men in dark suits watching&nbsp;him coldly from nearby: Secret Service agents.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You too, Mr. Chase,&#x201d; Dalton answered. &#x201c;English,&nbsp;huh? Not a Londoner, if I&#x2019;m right about the accent.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Too blood&#x2014;I mean, yeah, that&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m from&nbsp;Yorkshire.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Dalton nodded. &#x201c;Yorkshire, right. Nice part of the&nbsp;world, I understand.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad.&#x201d; Chase doubted the senator knew&nbsp;where Yorkshire was, or cared.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Senator Dalton&#x2019;s on the IHA&#x2019;s funding committee,&#x201d;&nbsp;Amoros told him.&nbsp;<br><br>Chase smirked. &#x201c;That right? Any chance of a pay&nbsp;raise?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Nina&#x2019;s glossily lipsticked mouth shrank into a tight&nbsp;line, but Dalton laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d; He&nbsp;looked past Chase, his eyebrows flicking in recognition.&nbsp;&#x201c;Say, our host approaches! Monsieur Corvus, good to&nbsp;meet you again!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Chase turned to see a sleekly groomed, black-haired&nbsp;man in a dinner jacket. He looked to be in his midfifties.&nbsp;&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; he said to Dalton as he shook hands,&nbsp;&#x201c;Ren�. This is a social event, yes? No need for tiresome&nbsp;formality!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever you say . . . Ren�!&#x201d; Dalton chuckled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you . . . Victor! And Nina,&#x201d; Corvus continued&nbsp;as he turned to Nina, taking her hand, &#x201c;such a pleasure&nbsp;to meet you again.&#x201d; He leaned forward and kissed her&nbsp;on both cheeks. Nina blushed. Chase glared at the&nbsp;Frenchman, quickly forcing a neutral expression when&nbsp;he turned to face him. &#x201c;And you, you must be . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Eddie Chase,&#x201d; Chase announced brusquely, sticking&nbsp;out his hand. &#x201c;Nina&#x2019;s boyfriend.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;But of course,&#x201d; said Corvus, smiling as he shook&nbsp;his hand. &#x201c;Ren� Corvus. Welcome aboard the <i>Ocean&nbsp;Emperor</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Cheers.&#x201d; Chase looked around at the oak-paneled&nbsp;room. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a really nice boat you&#x2019;ve got here. I suppose&nbsp;being a shipping magnet has its perks.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Dalton suppressed an amused noise, while Nina let&nbsp;out a fluttering, slightly desperate laugh. &#x201c;Ren�&#x2019;s not&nbsp;just a shipping <i>magnate</i>,&#x201d; she said to Chase, emphasizing&nbsp;the pronunciation of the word through clenched&nbsp;teeth, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s also one of the IHA&#x2019;s directors.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonexecutive, of course,&#x201d; Corvus added modestly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only proper that the experts like Nina should make&nbsp;the decisions about protecting the world&#x2019;s archaeological&nbsp;wonders.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well,&#x201d; said Chase with a big fake smile, &#x201c;she&nbsp;really does like to be in control of everything, I can&nbsp;tell you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Nina took a gulp from her glass before treating Chase&nbsp;to an equally false grin. &#x201c;Honey, sweetie?&#x201d; she said,&nbsp;tugging at his jacket sleeve. &#x201c;Can I speak to you? Over&nbsp;here?&#x201d; She tipped her head towards the doors.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you can, <i>darling</i>,&#x201d; he replied. He nodded&nbsp;to the other three men. &#x201c;Excuse us for a second.&#x201d; The&nbsp;trio exchanged knowing looks as he and Nina backed&nbsp;away.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What the <i>hell </i>are you doing?&#x201d; Nina hissed as soon as&nbsp;they were what she mistakenly thought was out of&nbsp;earshot.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you talking about?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You know damn well what I&#x2019;m talking about! Making&nbsp;an ass of yourself and embarrassing me!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, <i>I&#x2019;m </i>embarrassing <i>you</i>?&#x201d; snorted Chase. &#x201c;What&nbsp;about you and your &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s Eddie, my dogsbody at the&nbsp;IHA&#x2014;oh, and he&#x2019;s sort of my boyfriend as well&#x2019;?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>say that!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You might as well have! And <i>pardon bloody me </i>for&nbsp;getting a word wrong that no bugger uses in normal&nbsp;conversation. Not all of us could go to the University of&nbsp;Poncy Vocabulary. Or afford a five-hundred-dollar haircut,&#x201d;&nbsp;he added before he could stop himself.&nbsp;<br><br>Nina&#x2019;s eyes narrowed into angry slits. &#x201c;You <i>promised&nbsp;</i>me you were going to stop going on about that! The one&nbsp;time, the <i>one goddamn time </i>I need to look good to impress&nbsp;these people, and all I get is you complaining how much&nbsp;it cost!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It was <i>five hundred </i>fucking <i>dollars</i>!&#x201d; Chase reminded&nbsp;her. &#x201c;I can get a haircut for ten bucks!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!

What did you mean, I can afford&nbsp;a lot of stuff?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Forget it. I . . .&#x201d; He looked at the stairs again.&nbsp;It was too late. She&#x2019;d seen him.&nbsp;<br><br>The Chinese man swaggered through the crowd&nbsp;towards Corvus, people moving out of his path as if he&nbsp;were sweeping them aside with an invisible force field.&nbsp;Following a couple of paces behind was a younger&nbsp;woman. Unlike him, she was Caucasian. Brunette, stunningly&nbsp;beautiful, expensively attired . . . and wearing an&nbsp;expression of quiet sadness.</p><h2>Great Issues in American History, Vol. I: From Settlement to Revolution, 1584-1776</h2><p>This first volume of Great Issues in American History -- three volumes of documents that cover the history of America from its settlement to the present -- gives us a generous sampling from the major political controversies in the Colonial period. Included are such documents as Richard Hakluyt's "Discourse of Western Planting" (1584), "Letter from Christopher Columbus to the King and Queen of Spain" (undated, probably 1694), "The Third Virginia Charter" (1612), Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" (1776) and "The Declaration of independence" (July 4, 1776). Each has an explanatory headnote, and there are brief general introductions that set the selections in their historical context.<br><br>In order to fit both Colonial and Early National courses, documents covering 1765-1776 appear at the end of this volume and again at the beginning of Volume II.<br><br>Volume II From the Revolution to the Civil War, 1765-1865 Edited by Richard Hofstadter<br><br>Volume III From Reconstruction to the Present Day, 1864-1981<br><br>Edited by Richard Hofstadter and Beatrice K.

Taken in its entirety, his body of work reveals an artistry that outreaches the literary fads that so quickly swept him up. </p><p>Dark, funny, and exquisitely haunting, his final book-length fiction explores the fragile, mysterious shadowland surrounding death. Told with classic Brautigan wit, poetic style, and mordant irony, <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i> assumes the form of a peripatetic journal chronicling the protagonist's travels and oblique ruminations on the suicide of one woman, and a close friend's death from cancer. </p><p>After Richard Brautigan committed suicide, his only child, Ianthe Brautigan, found among his possessions the manuscript of <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i>. It had been completed over a year earlier, but was still unpublished at the time of his death. Finding it was too painful to face her father's presence page after page, she put the manuscript aside.</p><p>Years later, having completed a memoir about her father's life and death, Ianthe Brautigan reread An Unfortunate Woman, and finally, clear-eyed, she saw that it was her father's work at its best and had to be published.</p></p><p>In this posthumously released novel, Richard Brautigan's voice--quipping, punning, strewn with non sequiturs--comes like a rattling of chains. Brautigan took his own life in 1984; <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i> was written in the years immediately preceding, and the writer's imminent death haunts the book. It bears the subtitle <i>A Journey</i>, and Brautigan means this quite literally. We follow the first-person narrator in his peregrinations from Montana to San Francisco to New York to Alaska to Honolulu and back to San Francisco, with a detour across the bay to Berkeley--and that's leaving out Canada altogether. Pulling him like a wispy thread throughout is the hanging death of a San Francisco housemate who had cancer. We never learn her story, just that his book's "main theme is an unfortunate woman." She's a constant glancing reference.<p> Brautigan uses a journal format, with digressions galore, to explore the contingency of his own existence. He tells of loves past, homes past, the kitchens of friends and the beds of strangers. But like the old free-lovin' hippie he is, he never commits to any single story. Of one fellow he meets in Ketchikan: "He is one of those people who in a normal book, unfortunately not this one, would be developed into a memorable character." The author is forever warning you of a digression ahead or a story he'll get back to later. His references to the book in progress read, in this rueful context, not so much as self-indulgent cuteness, but as a kind of sad knowledge of the unkempt ways of his own mind. <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i> will not bring Brautigan many new fans, but devoted readers will find the dark, self-revealing side of a man who felt middle age like a blow to the head. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><p><b>Richard Brautigan</b> published 11 novels, a book of short stories, and 8 books of poetry during his short life.

Waltke begins the collaboration by first skillfully establishing the meaning of the chosen psalms through careful exegesis in which each text is interpreted in light of its historical backgrounds, its literary form, and the poet&#x2019;s rhetoric. James M. Houston then exposits each text&#x2019;s relevance in conjunction with the Church&#x2019;s interpretation of it throughout her history. To further the accuracy of this interpretation, he commissioned fresh translations of numerous Latin and Middle English texts. / The authors&#x2019; purpose in creating this volume was not merely to produce a masterful commentary. Rather, they wished to aid in enriching the daily life of the contemporary Christian and to deepen the church&#x2019;s community. Waltke and Houston here bring together the two voices of the Holy Spirit &#x2015; heard infallibly in Scripture and edifyingly in the Church&#x2019;s response &#x2015; in a rare and illuminating combination.</p><p>Bruce K.

Houston is founding principal and former chancellor of Regent College and was the college's first professor of spiritual theology.</p><h2>The Trial of Joan of Arc</h2><p><p>No account is more critical to our understanding of Joan of Arc than the contemporary record of her trial in 1431. Convened at Rouen and directed by bishop Pierre Cauchon, the trial culminated in Joan's public execution for heresy. The trial record, which sometimes preserves Joan's very words, unveils her life, character, visions, and motives in fascinating detail. Here is one of our richest sources for the life of a medieval woman.</p><p>This new translation, the first in fifty years, is based on the full record of the trial proceedings in Latin. Recent scholarship dates this text to the year of the trial itself, thereby lending it a greater claim to authority than had traditionally been assumed. Contemporary documents copied into the trial furnish a guide to political developments in Joan's career&#x2015;from her capture to the attempts to control public opinion following her execution.</p><p>Daniel Hobbins sets the trial in its legal and historical context. In exploring Joan's place in fifteenth-century society, he suggests that her claims to divine revelation conformed to a recognizable profile of holy women in her culture, yet Joan broke this mold by embracing a military lifestyle. By combining the roles of visionary and of military leader, Joan astonished contemporaries and still fascinates us today.</p><p>Obscured by the passing of centuries and distorted by the lens of modern cinema, the story of the historical Joan of Arc comes vividly to life once again.</p></p><p>Daniel Hobbins is Associate Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/HOBTRI_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>David Chipperfield Architects: Monograph Vol. II</h2><p><p>The British architect David Chipperfield (born 1953) founded his eponymous design firm in 1985, and has been an exemplary exponent of modernism and its ongoing relevance ever since. The confident elegance of his buildings extends a legacy of discreet craftsmanship and clarity learned from early 20th-century architecture: "If you look at a building by Mies van der Rohe," he observes, "it might look very simple, but up close, the sheer quality of construction, materials and thought are inspirational."</p><p><i>David Chipperfield Architects: Monograph Vol. II</i> brings the architect's most comprehensive monograph back into print in an updated edition that features 32 new works by Chipperfield's firm.

The eyes of the cattle were glazed, and the grass beneath their feet was brown and without vigor or life-giving nourishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sun was lost in a brassy sky, and when Calkins knelt and put his palm to the ground the earth was almost too hot to touch. He got slowly to his feet, his face unnaturally old with the gray film of dust and the stubble of beard on his jaws.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You ask for the truth.&#x201d; His voice was harsher than normal, and Ruth Gurney recognized it at once, and looked at him quickly, for as a child, she had known this man and had loved him like an uncle. &#x201c;All right, you&#x2019;ll get the truth. There&#x2019;s no chance of you making money on this herd. Half your cows will die this side of Dodge. They&#x2019;ll die of thirst and heat, and the rest won&#x2019;t be worth the drive. You&#x2019;re broke, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips tightened and as the truth penetrated she was filled with desperation coupled with a feminine desire for tears. All along she had guessed as much, but one-and-all the hands had avoided telling her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But what&#x2019;s the matter, Lon? The Circle G always made its drives before, and always made money. We&#x2019;ve the same men, and the trail&#x2019;s the same.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; He spoke flatly. &#x201c;Nothin&#x2019;s the same. The trail&#x2019;s bad. It&#x2019;s been a strikin&#x2019; dry year, and we got a late start. The other herds got the good grass, and trampled the rest into the dust. She&#x2019;s hotter&#x2019;n usual, too. And,&#x201d; he added grimly, &#x201c;we ain&#x2019;t got the same men.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But we have, Lon!&#x201d; Ruth protested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; He was old and stubborn. &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t. We got one new one too many, and the one we should have ain&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips tightened and her chin lifted. &#x201c;You mean Hoey Ives. You don&#x2019;t like him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You should spit in the river, I don&#x2019;t! Nor do the others. He&#x2019;s plumb bad, ma&#x2019;am, whether you believe it or not. He&#x2019;s no-account. I&#x2019;ll allow, he&#x2019;s educated and slick talkin&#x2019;, but he&#x2019;s still an Ives, and a bigger pack of coyotes never drew breath.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you think this&#x2014;this Lonigan would make a difference? What can one man do against heat and dust and distance? What could he do to prevent storms and rustler raids?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t for knowing. If&#x2019;n I did, mebbe this herd would get through in shape. But Lonigan would know, and Lonigan would take her through. Nor would he take any guff from Hoey Ives. I&#x2019;ll tell you, ma&#x2019;am, Hoey ain&#x2019;t along for fun. He comes of a pack of outlaws, and education ain&#x2019;t changed his breed none.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t talk about Mr. Ives any further, Lon. Not one word. I have utmost confidence in him. When the drive is over I...I may marry him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lon Calkins stared at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill him first, or die shooting. Your pappy was a friend of mine. I&#x2019;ll not see a daughter of his marry into that outfit.&#x201d; Then he added, more calmly. &#x201c;If&#x2019;n that&#x2019;s what you figure, Ruth, you better plan on hirin&#x2019; new hands when you get back to Texas.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very well, then, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll do, Lon.&#x201d; Her voice was even, but inside her words frightened her. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just what I&#x2019;ll do. I own the Circle G, and I&#x2019;ll run it my way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> CALKINS SAID NOTHING for a long minute, and then he mused. &#x201c;I wonder sometimes if&#x2019;n anybody does own a brand. The Circle G, ma&#x2019;am, ain&#x2019;t just a brand on some cows. It ain&#x2019;t just some range in Texas. It&#x2019;s more...much, much more.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t much hand to talkin&#x2019; of things like that, but you remember when your pappy and us come west? The Comanches killed O&#x2019;Brien and Kid Leslie on the Brazos. I reckon both of them were part of the Circle G, ma&#x2019;am. And Tony, that lousy Italian grub hustler, the one who rolled under a chuck wagon down on the cowhouse. He was part of the Circle G, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A brand ain&#x2019;t just a sign on a critter, it&#x2019;s the lives, and guts, and blood of all the men that went to build it, ma&#x2019;am. You can&#x2019;t get away from that, no way. The Circle G is your pappy standin&#x2019; over your mother when she died givin&#x2019; birth to you. The Circle G is all of that.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nobody owns a brand, ma&#x2019;am, like I say; nobody. It&#x2019;s a thing that hangs in the air over a ranch, over its cows, and over its men. You know why that kid Wilkeson got killed in Uvalde? An hombre there said this was a lousy outfit, and the kid reached for his gun. He died for the brand, ma&#x2019;am, like a hundred good and bad men done afore this. And you want to wipe it out, destroy it, just because you got your mind set on a no-account coyote. I wish Lonigan was back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lonigan!&#x201d; She burst out furiously. &#x201c;All you talk about is Lonigan! Who is he? What is he? What difference can one man make?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Calkins said grimly, &#x201c;your pappy made a sight of difference! If&#x2019;n he was with this drive now, your fancy Hoey Ives would pack out of here so fast his dust would be big &#x201c;ger&#x2019;n that raised by the herd! Or if Lonigan was. Fact is,&#x201d; he added grimly, &#x201c;there ain&#x2019;t nary a cowhand down there wouldn&#x2019;t draw on Hoey tomorrow if&#x2019;n he figured he had a chance. Hoey&#x2019;s killed ten men, all better&#x2019;n him except with a gun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And yet you think Lonigan could beat him?&#x201d; she asked wryly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mebbe. I ain&#x2019;t sure, but I am sure of one thing. If Lonigan died you can bet your boots Hoey Ives would die with him! You say,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;what difference can one man make? Well, he can make a sight of difference. Lonigan doesn&#x2019;t talk so much; he&#x2019;s a good worker, but he&#x2019;s got something in him, something more&#x2019;n most men. He ain&#x2019;t so big, rightly he&#x2019;s not, but he seems big, and he rode for the brand, Lonigan did. He loved the Circle G. Loved it like it was his own.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then where is he now when we need him?&#x201d; Ruth demanded bitterly. &#x201c;This...this superman of yours. Where is he now? You say he never missed a trail drive, that he would drift off, but somehow like he knew the day and hour, he would show up and take his place with the herd. Where is he now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mebbe he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; Calkins was grim. &#x201c;Wherever he is, he&#x2019;s with the Circle G, and we&#x2019;re with him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They looked up at the sound of hoofs, and Lon Calkins&#x2019;s face tightened grimly. Abruptly, he reined his horse around. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ridin&#x2019;,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You meant what you said about quitting?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If he stays,&#x201d; Calkins insisted, &#x201c;I go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be sorry to lose you, Lon. The Circle G won&#x2019;t be the same without you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His old eyes met hers and he stared at her. &#x201c;Believe me, it won&#x2019;t. Your father should have had a son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He rode away then, and she stared after him, her body feeling empty as an old sack. The approaching hoofs drew nearer and slowed, and her eyes turned with relief toward those of Hoey Ives.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a big young man with hard black eyes in which she had never seen the cruelty or calculation that lay in their depths. He rode magnificently and was a top hand. On this trip he had been her mainstay, ramrodding it through, talking to lift her spirits, advising her and helping her in countless ways. It was he who had selected the trail they took, he who had ridden out alone to meet the rustlers that would have stopped them, and who talked them out of trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with the old man?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he growling about now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, he was talking about the old days on the Circle G,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and about Lonigan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lonigan?&#x201d; Hoey&#x2019;s gaze sharpened, and for an instant she seemed to read apprehension in his eyes. &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t heard from him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nobody has. Yet he always made the drive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; Ives replied. &#x201c;He must be. I knew he always made the drive, and that was why I waited before offering my services. We never got along, you see.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he like?&#x201d; she asked curiously.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lonigan?&#x201d; Ives hesitated, while his bay stamped its foot restlessly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a killer. Utterly vicious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But the boys liked him,&#x201d; Ruth protested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure. He was their pride and joy,&#x201d; Ives said bitterly. &#x201c;He led the Circle G parade. No man, not even your father, had as much influence with the hands. He was loudmouthed and a braggart, but he appealed to them, and they found excuses for his killings.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yet he must have something...?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hoey Ives nodded reluctantly. &#x201c;He had that. There was something about him, something that frightened men who didn&#x2019;t even know him.&#x201d;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Ives rejoined the herd, and Ruth Gurney rode on, lingering along the hillcrests away from the dust, watching the herd that meant everything to her. The sale of that herd could mean the ranch was out of debt, that it was hers, all hers. Yet she knew that what Calkins had said was true, bitterly true. Not half the herd would live to see Dodge, and she would be broke then, broke and finished.<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned her horse and put him on up the slope to the very top of the long, low hill that ran beside the trail. On top there might be more breeze. And there was, although but little more. Yet she sat her horse there, looking over the brown, trampled-down grass that stretched on beyond it. There, too, the herds had been. The earlier herds that had started sooner.<br> &nbsp;<br> The failure of Lonigan to appear had caused most of that delay. All along she had realized why Calkins was waiting, why the hands kept looking toward the trail, why they found excuses to ride into town, why they intercepted every drifting horseman to ask about him, but for the first time he had not appeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> She pushed on across the ridge, riding due west. The sun was already far down toward the horizon but it was still unbearably hot. Heat waves danced and rippled against the sky along the ridges, and she slowed her horse to a walk and pushed on alone, lost now from the herd, with only the rising dust to mark its presence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Half asleep, lulled by the heat and the even rhythm of the walking horse, she dozed in the saddle, and then the horse stopped and coolness touched her face. She was atop another ridge, and far toward the west she seemed to see a thin edge of green, and then her eyes dropped and she saw the tracks of a horse. The horse was shod and the tracks were fresh.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without doubt the tracks were no more than an hour old, two hours at most. In that time the herd had moved less than three miles, so its dust cloud would have been within sight. Why had the strange rider avoided them?<br> &nbsp;<br> His horse had stopped here on this ridge, and from the tracks he must have watched the dust cloud. It was unusual for a rider to be so close and not to approach the herd. Unless&#x2014;she frowned and bit her lip&#x2014;unless he was an outlaw.<br> &nbsp;<br> She realized instantly that she should ride to the herd and let Calkins know. Rather, let Hoey Ives know. It might be another raid, and rustlers had already hit them for over three hundred head of stock. Nevertheless, her curiosity aroused, she turned her horse and started backtracking the man.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Transcending: Reflections Of Crime Victims</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are victims of crime destined to have the rest of their lives shaped by the crimes they've experienced? ("What happened to the road map for living the rest of my life?" asks a woman whose mother was murdered.) Will victims of crime always be bystanders in the justice system? ("We're having a problem forgiving the judge and the system," says the father of a young man killed in prison.) Is it possible for anyone to transcend such a comprehensively destructive, identity altering occurrence? ("I thought, I'm going to run until I'm not angry anymore," expresses a woman who was assaulted.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howard Zehr presents the portraits and the courageous stories of 39 victims of violent crime in Transcending: Reflections of Crime Victims. Many of these people were twice-wounded: once at the hands of an assailant; the second time by the courts, where there is no legal provision for a victim's participation. "My hope," says Zehr, "is that this book might hand down a rope to others who have experienced such tragedies and traumas, and that it might allow all who read it to live on the healing edge."</p><p>"This book is a powerful wake-up call.&#x201d; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;These beautifully written, moving stories communicate powerfully the depth and complexity of every victim&#x2019;s individual experience with crime. Each profile not only reminds us why we should listen to victims, but challenges us to embrace a new vision of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Howard Zehr has given us a book with truth and wisdom on every page.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014; Susan Herman, Executive Director, National Center for Victims of Crime, Arlington, Virginia </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This book is essential reading. I defy anyone who reads this book to remain indifferent to the issues it raises. I applaud Dr. Zehr&#x2019;s efforts to bring clarity to this process by offering victims a chance to tell fully their side of the story. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This book is a powerful wake-up call on so many levels. We no longer have an excuse for avoiding the issues this book raises. I hope it can be used to enlighten, inform, and encourage discourse about the kind of society we want to inhabit.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014; Tom Kennedy, The Washington Post (former Editor of Photography for National Geographic) </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Howard Zehr did something not enough of us takes the time to do&#x2014;he listened to victims about what they need. That is where justice reform and victim services should begin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Transcending: Reflections of Crime Victims should be mandatory reading for anyone with an interest in justice, especially politicians, advocates, judges&#x2014;and anyone who works with victims.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014; Steve Sullivan, President of the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, Ottawa, Ontario </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This book is a graphic acknowledgment that crime can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime, at any place. It is also an elegant reminder that none of us knows how we will react to our own victimization or that of other people, and that each of us has our own vision of what justice truly means.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014; Cheryl Guidry Tyiska, Director of Victim Services, National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.</p><br>Howard Zehr is widely known as &#x201c;the grandfather of restorative justice.&#x201d; Since 1996 he has been Professor of Restorative Justice at the Center for Justice &amp; Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University, Harrisonburg, VA, an international graduate program for justice and peacebuilding practitioners.

Brown during the 1980s, exploring a wide-ranging array of topics concerning Islam. Brown reveals the overlooked relationship between Islam and early Christianity, exploring Islam&#x2019;s relation to, and revision of, the Christian tradition, the literary innovation of the Qu&#x2019;ran, the nature of revolutionary and political Islam, and the vision of a world civilization.<br><br>Throughout these lectures, which are remarkably pertinent today, Brown seeks to educate the reader on misunderstood areas of Islam, including the split between the Sunni and Shi&#x2019;ite sects and Islam&#x2019;s exemplification of the broad themes of art and imagination in human life. The author&#x2019;s world-historical perspective of religion and tradition gives readers a crucial alternative to the divisive &#x201c;clash of civilizations&#x201d; view that paints Islam as at odds with the West. He exposes the unifying strands between Islam and early Judeo-Christian doctrine, showing that Islam is in fact a genuine part of &#x201c;Western&#x201d; tradition, and more importantly, part of a global tradition that embraces us all.</p><p>Norman O.

To do otherwise would have exposed them to terrorism from the vigilant right wing. Yet this insightful book by a Japanese-American scholar who grew up in both cultures reveals the hidden fault lines in the realm of the dying emperor by telling the stories of three unlikely dissenters: a supermarket owner who burned the national flag; an aging widow who challenged the state&#39;s &#34;deification&#34; of fallen soldiers; and the mayor of Nagasaki, who risked his career and his life by suggesting that Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.</p><p>&#34;Through the voices of &#39;ordinary&#39; Japanese, Norma Field has given us something rare and valuable--an incisive critique of conservative Japanese ideologies and practices, a critique which still finds hope for genuine democracy and anti-militarism in the values and actions of individual Japanese men and women. No other Western book on Japan today is simultaneously so intimate at the personal level and far-reaching in its social and political implications.&#34; --John Dower"Well-researched, well-observed and completely absorbing...an important and necessary book." -- The New York Times Book Review<p>"Remarkable...a vivid, taut, graceful piece of writing...with enormous power."-- James Fallows, The Atlantic</p><p>"Marvelous...Field uncovers a Japan rarely seen or acknowledged by Westerners, a Japan of individual expression, active dissent -- even open rebellion."-- Village Voice Literary Supplement</p><p>"Superb...one of the most important books...on Japanese who refuse to conform." -- Ian Buruma, The New York Review of Books</p></p><h2>Catfantastic: Nine Lives and Fifteen Tales</h2><p>Two of the biggest names in the fantasy field have put together a unique collection of fantastical cat tales for friends of furry felines.

J had done this every morning of his life, every morning he could remember, and, despite Q&#x2019;s theories on likelihoods and probabilities (his idea that eventually someone must fail in order to justify a lifetime of Inspections), J felt no doubt, no dread, no fear.<br><br>&#x201c;Enter, J,&#x201d; Collins called. Collins, the stuffiest, oldest, burliest Inspector of all. The man smelled of old textbooks. His belly hung so far over his belt D joked he kept an Alphabet Boy hidden in there. That&#x2019;s where we come from, D had said. But all the Alphabet Boys knew they came from the Orchard, having grown on the Living Trees.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; Collins said. It was a wonder any words at all made it through the man&#x2019;s bushy brown mustache.<br><br>J knew the Inspector did not speak for himself.<br><br>D.A.D. must&#x2019;ve given the signal it was time to begin.<br><br>To the snickers of L, D, and Q behind him, J entered and removed his pajamas, folding them and placing them in a neat pile upon the steel end table by the Check-�Up room door. As the door was closing behind J, D called, &#x201c;Shoulda showered, J!&#x201d; And J pointed at him, the Alphabet Boys&#x2019; gesture that meant, You&#x2019;re a jerk, brother.<br><br>The door locked into place, his clothes nicely piled, J stepped to the pair of rubber footprints on the cold steel floor. Winter was close, arriving perhaps as soon as tomorrow. And while J enjoyed the Effigy Meet as much as his brothers, he liked to keep the cold outside. The Check-�Up room was as frigid as any he knew in the Turret.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn,&#x201d; Inspector Collins said. He and Jeffrey observed from a distance, always the first step of the morning&#x2019;s Inspection. The dogs breathed heavy behind the glass door beyond the men. J turned to his left. He heard the leather of D.A.D.&#x2019;s red jacket stretching. The man, as of yet out of sight, must have crossed his arms or sat back in his chair.<br><br>Winter outside the Turret could be brutal. Some years were worse than others. J, nearing his thirteenth birthday along with his twenty-�three brothers, had experienced twelve winters. And with each one, Professor Gulch warned the boys about depression. The sense of loneliness that came from being stuck inside a ten-�story tower, when the Orchard and the Yard froze over, when even the pines looked too cold to survive.<br><br>Hysteria, J thought. He shook his head, trying to roll the idea out his ear. It was a word he didn&#x2019;t like anywhere inside his head. As if the four syllables had the same properties as Rotts and Moldus, Vees and Placasores. The very diseases the Inspectors searched him for now.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn.&#x201d;<br><br>Collins again. His gruff voice part and parcel of the Check-�Up room. Like the sound of clacking dishes in the cafeteria. Or the choral voices of his brothers in the Body Hall.<br><br>&#x201c;Cold,&#x201d; J said, turning his back to the Inspectors, facing now the locked door.<br><br>It was often chilly in the Check-�Up room; unseen breezes, as if the solid-�steel walls were only an illusion, and the distorted reflections unstable drawing on the wind. J imagined a slit somewhere, a crack in those walls, allowing pre-�winter inside. It was similar, J thought, to the veterinarian&#x2019;s office in Lawrence Luxley&#x2019;s book Dogs and Dog Days. The brilliant leisure writer had described the poor animals&#x2019; reactions so well:<br><br>Unwelcoming, cold, it was as though Doctor Grand had intentionally made it so, so that the dogs understood the severity of their visits. And still, despite the inhospitable environs, the dogs understood that the room was good for them. That their lives depended on these regular visits. Some of them were even able to suppress their basest instincts&nbsp;. . . the ones that told them to run.<br><br>J had memorized all of Lawrence Luxley&#x2019;s books. Many of the Alphabet Boys had.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn.&#x201d;<br><br>J did as he was told. Always had. The routine of the Inspections was as ingrained in his being as chewing before swallowing.<br><br>And with this third turn, he faced D.A.D.<br><br>A thrill ran through him, as it always had, twelve years running, to see D.A.D. for the first time in the day.<br><br>The bright-�red jacket and pants were like a warm fire in the cold Check-�Up room. Or the sun coming up. &#x201c;Did you sleep well,&nbsp;J?&#x201d;<br><br>D.A.D.&#x2019;s voice. Always direct, always athletic. J wasn&#x2019;t the only Alphabet Boy who equated the man&#x2019;s voice with strength. Comfort. Security. Knowledge.<br><br>&#x201c;I actually did not,&#x201d; J said, his twelve-�year-�old voice an octave deeper than it was only a year ago. &#x201c;I dreamt something terrible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; D.A.D.&#x2019;s hazel eyes shone above his black beard, his hair black, too. J had black hair. Just like his D.A.D. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m intrigued. Tell me all about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Turn,&#x201d; Collins said. And J turned to face the Inspectors and the dogs all over again.<br><br>No longer facing D.A.D., the color red like a nosebleed out of the corner of his eye now, J recounted his unconscious struggle. He&#x2019;d been lost in a Yard four hundred times the size of the one he enjoyed every day. He described the horror of not being able to find his way back to the Turret.<br><br>&#x201c;Lost?&#x201d; D.A.D. echoed. The obvious interest in his voice was as clear to J as the subtle sound of his leather gloves folding around his pencil.<br><br>Yes, J told him, yes, he&#x2019;d felt lost in the dream. He&#x2019;d somehow strayed too far from the Turret and the Parenthood within. He couldn&#x2019;t remember how exactly&#x2014;�the actual pines framing the Yard in were not present in this dream. But he was certainly very anxious to get back. He could hear his floor mates Q, D, and L calling from a distance but could not see the orange bricks of the tower. He couldn&#x2019;t make out the iron spires that framed the roof&#x2019;s ledge like a lonely bottom row of teeth. Teeth J and the other Alphabet Boys had looked through many nights, having found the nerve to sneak up to the roof. Nor could he see the tallest of the spires, the single iron tooth that pointed to the sky like a fang. Gone were the finite acres of the Yard, the expanse of green lawn between himself and the Turret. So were the reflections in the many elongated windows of the many floors. In their stead was endless green grass.<br><br>And fog.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, winter is upon us,&#x201d; D.A.D. said. His voice was control. Always. Direction. Solution. Order. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t even see the fang, hmm? No sign of the Parenthood at all. No sign of home.&#x201d;<br><br>J thought of the yellow door on the roof, visible all the way from the Yard below. He thought of the solid orange bricks and how, on a summer day, the Turret resembled a sunrise.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head, looking to the silent faces of the Inspectors, who quietly fingered the magnifying glasses at their belts. J understood now, as a twelve-�year-�old boy, something he hadn&#x2019;t at eleven: The Inspections didn&#x2019;t begin when the Inspectors used their glasses. It began the second you walked through the door.<br><br>&#x201c;You must have been so scared,&#x201d; D.A.D. continued. His voice was fatherhood. Administration. Always. &#x201c;But, tell me, did you eventually find the Turret before waking?&#x201d;<br><br>J was quiet a moment. He scratched at his right elbow with his left hand. He yawned a second time.<br><br>Hysteria, he thought again. He actually made fists, as if to knock the thought out of his head. Professor Gulch taught psychology and often stressed the many ways a boy&#x2019;s mind might turn on itself: mania, attention deficit, persecution, dissociation from reality, depression, and hysteria. For J, it had all sounded like distant impossibilities. Conditions to be studied for the purpose of study alone. Certainly J wasn&#x2019;t afraid of one day experiencing these states of mind himself. Yet here he was&nbsp;. . . twelve years old&nbsp;. . . and how else could he explain the new, unknown feelings he&#x2019;d been having of late? What would Gulch call the sense of isolation, of being incomplete, when he looked out across the Yard, toward the entrance to the many rows of the Orchard? To where the Living Trees grew?<br><br>The boy recalled his childhood as though through a glass with residue of milk upon it. Unable to answer the simple question: Where do I come from?<br><br>Another Lawrence Luxley line. A real zinger, as Q would say.<br><br>But no, J thought, there in the Check-�Up room. He wasn&#x2019;t trying to answer that question at all. No boy had ever determined which of the cherry trees in the Orchard were the ones they had grown on. And as far as J knew, they were fine with that.<br><br>Weren&#x2019;t they?</p><h2>Into the Sunset: Photography&#39;s Image of the American West (Museum of Modern Art, New York: Exhibition Catalogues)</h2><p><i>Into the Sunset</i> examines how photography has pictured, established and transformed the idea of the American West, from 1850 to the present. The development of photography coincided with the exploration and settlement of the West, and this simultaneous growth resulted in a complex relationship that has shaped the perception of that region's physical and social landscape to this day. Published to accompany a major exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, <i>Into the Sunset</i> charts changing myths and cultural attitudes about the West through photographs dating from the nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries. An expansive and dynamic survey, it brings together photographers as diverse as Carleton E. Watkins and Stephen Shore, Darius Kinsey and Dorothea Lange, Robert Frank and Cindy Sherman, an unknown daguerreotypist and Richard Prince. More than 120 works are organized thematically to highlight the artists' differing views of the West's land and people.</p><p></p><h2>Comfort for the Sick and Dying: And for Those Who Love Them</h2><p><p>Here is a storehouse of Christian wisdom for people facing the most vulnerable and desperate times of their lives: the onset of serious illness or the approach of death.

She explores the intricate patterns of the novel, its chronology, locations, imagery, and use of color, and how these contribute to a seamless interplay of social comedy and symbolic landscape. She devotes a perceptive chapter to Fitzgerald&#39;s controversial portrayal of women, and goes on to discuss how the central characters, Gatsby and Nick Carraway, embody and confront the dualism inherent in the American dream.</p><p><b>Kathleen Parkinson</b> is an author.</p><h2>Lost Boys</h2><p><i><b>Lost Boys</b></i>, Slava Mogutin&#x2019;s first monograph, is a compelling collection of his portraits and landscapes taken over the past ten years&#x2014;since he was exiled from Russia for &#x201c;malicious hooliganism with exceptional cynicism and extreme insolence.&#x201d; Although it was his outspoken gay writing that angered the Soviet authorities, Mogutin&#x2019;s photographs caused just as much controversy. Provocative yet iconoclastic, his work transcends the conventions of male nude photography, confronting the viewer/voyeur with a raw style and new sensibility. A cross between porn and fashion, pop culture and marginal kink, <b><i>Lost Boys</i></b> is a poetic and sometimes raunchy journey into different obsessions and fetishes of the cosmopolitan urban youth culture. Crimean rasta boys, Russian wrestlers and military cadets, German skinheads, and football hooligans are among the subjects of these incendiary but intimate portraits.</p><p><b>Slava Mogutin</b> was the last political dissident from the former Soviet Union and the first ever to become a porn star.

Epic in scope, passionate in its conviction, and set against a backdrop of plausible events, it tells the brilliant story of Earth&#x2019;s first interstellar colonists&#x2014;and the mysterious planet that becomes their home...</p><p><b>Allen Steele</b> was a journalist who covered the space program. He later turned to fiction writing, and his first novel, <i>Orbital Decay</i>, published by Ace Books, was chosen as the best first novel of the year by <i>Locus</i>. Allen himself went on to be nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. He began writing and selling to the science fiction magazines and is a three-time Hugo Award winner for his short fiction. In 2013, he received the Robert A. Heinlein Award for outstanding published works in science fiction.At first, this novel from Hugo winner Steele looks like a fairly conventional tale of high-tech intrigue-in this case, rebels against a right-wing American dictatorship plot to steal the prototype interstellar spaceship built to immortalize the government's ideology by planting a colony of fanatics on another star's planet. However, once the freedom seekers arrive on the new world, Coyote, things get a lot more interesting. Coyote is habitable but alien, full of flora and fauna that upset the colonists' easy preconceptions. The young people, in particular, have to find their identities in a dangerous but wonderful environment; their discovery of what they can do individually as well as what they owe to the group nicely illustrates the name the starship's captain, R.E. Lee, has given their settlement: Liberty. That Steele's novel has been stitched together out of a series of short stories has advantages and disadvantages. The jumping around can be repetitious, but it also lets readers see the same events from different angles. By the same token, the narrative doesn't stay with individual characters, especially adults, long enough for the reader to get to know them, but it does give a panorama of the developing community. By the end, when an especially big challenge appears, the colonists are ready to face it confidently. The discovery of a new world is one of SF's most potent themes, and Steele handles it well.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beauty Pop, Vol. 4 (4)</h2><p>Kiri steps in to help the injured Narumi in a Scissors Project beauty battle.

The narrative is interspersed with more than 1,100 extracts from letters by, to, and about Renoir, 452 of which come from unpublished letters. Renoir became hugely popular despite great obstacles: thirty years of poverty followed by thirty years of progressive paralysis of his fingers. Despite these hardships, much of his work is optimistic, even joyful. Close friends who contributed money, contacts, and companionship enabled him to overcome these challenges to create more than 4,000 paintings. Renoir had intimate relationships with fellow artists (Caillebotte, C�zanne, Monet, and Morisot), with his dealers (Durand-Ruel, Bernheim, and Vollard) and with his models (Lise, Aline, Gabrielle, and D�d�e). Barbara Ehrlich White&#x2019;s lifetime of research informs this fascinating biography that challenges common misconceptions surrounding Renoir&#x2019;s reputation.</p><p>Since 1961 White has studied more than 3,000 letters relating to <em>Renoir</em> and gained unique insight into his personality and character. Renoir provides an unparalleled and intimate portrait of this complex artist through images of his own iconic paintings, his own words, and the words of his contemporaries.</p><p>&#x201c;Barbara White is a biographer of courage, seriousness and unrelenting honesty. She has read and dissected about 3,000 letters about Renoir written by him, his friends, his family, as well as the newspapers of the day. Practically every member of the Renoir family has entrusted their personal documents to her &#x2013; a pledge of trust totally deserved. Whenever I am asked a question about Auguste, I write to Barbara to ask her opinion or call on her knowledge, since she has become an indisputable reference for me. She is always careful and verifies facts and contexts by every route possible. The Renoir family, and Auguste himself, are very lucky that Barbara is so passionate about her subject, and I feel personally lucky to know her. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for this work of a lifetime &#x2013; a magnificent success. I am very pleased that her book has been edited by the quality editors at Thames &amp; Hudson, as it will remain a point of reference for many generations to come.&#x201d; &#x2013; Sophie Renoir (great-granddaughter of Auguste Renoir, granddaughter of his eldest son Pierre, and daughter of Renoir&#x2019;s grandson Claude Renoir, Jr.), June 7, 2017<br></p> 105 illustrations, 58 in color</p><p>Barbara Ehrlich White is Adjunct Professor Emerita of Art History at Tufts University, Massachusetts.

We learn about the Impressionists with whom Renoir traveled and the official Salon against which they sometimes rebelled. Manet, Monet, C�zanne and Pissarro all make appearances, as does the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who created a market for these painters. Along the way, we also learn a great deal about 19th�century French society and mores.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A well-rounded view of the artist&#x2019;s personal and professional life... White&#x2019;s readable, intriguing study sheds new light on misconceptions regarding Renoir&#x2019;s personality. Readers with prior knowledge of the artist will love to learn more, while those interested in the impressionists will enjoy peeking into the lives of artists such as Monet, C�zanne, and others.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Renoir portrayed here is a generous, cheerful man but also a furtive and sometimes duplicitous one, a painter of genius who often churned out hackwork, a loving husband who constantly worried his wife would find out about the systematic lies he'd been telling her for years. It's a Renoir scarcely hinted at in the sunny swirl of his paintings &#x2013; and all the more fascinating for that.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Moving... <em>Renoir: An Intimate Biography</em> is Ms. White&#x2019;s second study of the painter, drawing on an additional 2,000 letters made available to her since her <em>Renoir: His Life, Art, and Letters</em> appeared in 1984. Through her command of Renoir&#x2019;s correspondence we get vivid glimpses of his inner life.... She is reliably content to let Renoir speak for himself, allowing his grounded aims, temperament, and wit to shine through.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An in-depth biography of the French impressionist painter... ideal for readers seeking to delve deeply into Renoir's personality. White, one of the leading authorities on the life and work of Renoir, offers an &#x2018;intimate&#x2019; look into his life, a narrative fueled by her amassing a cache of more than 3,000 letters&#x2015;many from the families of Renoir's illegitimate daughter, Jeanne, and his three sons, including the great film director Jean, as well as from fellow artists. They shed particular light on his relationships with key women in his life, especially his wife, female models, and fellow artist Berthe Morisot.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A moving biography of French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir, sourced from thousands of letters and hundreds of previously unpublished writings by the artist, his family, and his friends, including many first-generation impressionists.

Using that correspondence and the fruits of her life&#x2019;s research, she creates a finely nuanced portrait of depth and feeling. Studded with stirring quotations from unpublished letters and embellished with reproductions of many of Renoir&#x2019;s most-beloved works, this is a jewel of a biography, and it will be treasured by anyone interested in art.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;For Renoir devotees, this is an unmissable, revelatory account... This documentary life, based on thousands of letters, many unpublished, which White has collected since 1961, is the most personal account of any Impressionist ever written. It engages with Renoir from a domestic rather than art historical perspective, bringing to quotidian life the stick-thin, wiry, energetic painter, pipe in mouth, as he converses in a rasping guttural Paris accent to friends and lovers, rearranges his cluttered studio, chats to servants in the grand homes of his collectors. Nineteenth-century Parisian bohemia has long been frozen into myth; White&#x2019;s return to primary sources allows her to catch the timbre of felt experience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Financial Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;No one, not even Renoir himself, can ever have commanded so much information on the topic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Daily Telegraph</em></strong></p><h2>How Carriers Fought: Carrier Operations in WWII</h2><p>In November 1921 the first purpose-built aircraft carrier was launched by the Japanese, followed a year later by the launch of the British Hermes. The conversion of battlecruisers into aircraft carriers after World War I required the consideration of issues including handling aircraft on the flight deck and the techniques of attacking enemy ships, and the evolution of carrier operations was ongoing when World War II broke out. With a focus on the conflict in the Pacific between the U.S. Navy and the imperial Japanese fleet, this title examines how aircraft carriers fought during World War II by first considering all the tools and building blocks of carrier operations, and then discussing the various battles that involved aircraft carriers to explore how carrier operations evolved during war.<br><br>Every aspect of carrier operations is covered; from the technology used on the carriers and in aircraft including for navigation and communication, to what life was really like in the cockpit for the pilots. A world of tactical dehydration, amphetamine pills, and illegal smoking is explored, as well as the measures pilots implemented to reduce their risk of death in the event of being hit.<br><br>The major carrier battles of the war are considered, from Coral Sea to Leyte Gulf, with a focus on how the tools of carrier operations were employed. At the battle of Midway the debate of concentration vs. dispersion became relevant, as the Japanese decided to divide their forces while the Americans concentrated theirs. How Carriers Fought questions these tactics, exploring which worked best in theory and in practice.<br>The book concludes with a discussion of how carrier operations changed during the course of the war, as better technology and a better understanding of this new type of warfare allowed for quick advances in how operations were carried out.</p><p>Lars Celander has had a lifelong interest in naval and military history.

Her Crystal Cave, the only New Age shop in Pecan Springs, Texas, is in the same century-old stone building that houses my herb shop, Thyme and Seasons, and our jointly owned tearoom, Thyme for Tea. The building is surrounded with herb gardens, and at this moment, I was working in the garden out front.</p><p>Thyme and Seasons and its herb gardens are a far cry from the Houston law office where I used to work as a criminal defense attorney. Leaving the law, moving to a small town, and opening my own business these are the best things I&#x2019;ve ever done for myself (second only to marrying Mike McQuaid, that is). And while some people might find small-town life limited or low on thrills and excitement, that hasn&#x2019;t been a problem for me. Between the shop, my family, and my friends, I have just about all the excitement I can handle. And if I want to kick up my heels in the big city, it takes less than an hour to drive from Pecan Springs to either Austin or San Antonio. Altogether, it&#x2019;s a nice arrangement.</p><p>Ruby bent over to peer doubtfully at the plant. &#x201c;That dinky little twig is ginkgo? It&#x2019;s got a heck of a lot of growing to do. The last ginkgo I saw was a tree. A big tree.&#x201d; She looked up. &#x201c;Taller than this building.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give it time,&#x201d; I said with a grin, and picked up my shovel. &#x201c;Like about five hundred years. I started this little guy from a cutting, and it&#x2019;s got some growing to do.&#x201d; The oldest surviving tree on earth, ginkgo was once described by Charles Darwin as a &#x201c;living fossil,&#x201d; because so many of its primitive botanical features are still intact. Extracts made from its leaves have been used for over five thousand years to improve blood circulation, treat asthma and bronchitis, and enhance memory. And even if it were entirely useless, I would still enjoy the dappled shade created by its fan-shaped green leaves. While this little fellow begins stretching up to his full height, I&#x2019;m going to put up a sign letting people know that his ancestors were already ancient when humans were just beginning to rub sticks together.</p><p>From the back door of the shop, my helper, Laurel Riley, waved at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wanted on the phone, China,&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Hannah Bucher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good,&#x201d; I said, shouldering my shovel and heading for the shop, Ruby tagging along behind. Hannah is a seventy-something herb gardener who lives in Cedar Crossing, not far away. She specializes in thyme, growing and selling dozens of different varieties of this beautiful herb. She had promised to give me some plants of a new cultivar of lemon thyme, so I could try it in my garden. I&#x2019;d been waiting impatiently for her call.</p><p>But Hannah hadn&#x2019;t phoned to talk about herbs. Instead, she&#x2019;d called to ask me to come to Cedar Crossing to see her, and something in her voice prompted me to ask why.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an urgent personal matter,&#x201d; she said. She lowered her voice, as if she were afraid she might be overheard. &#x201c;I hate to say it, China, but I&#x2019;m afraid someone is &#x201d; She stopped, and then in a lighter, brighter voice, went on: &#x201c;I do hope you&#x2019;ll be able to come and get those lemon thyme plants soon. I&#x2019;ve been saving them for you. When can you come?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced at the calendar. McQuaid and Brian my husband and our thirteen-year-old were going to Houston the next weekend to catch an Astros game. &#x201c;How about Sunday?&#x201d; I asked. Ruby and I had been meaning to visit our friends Barbara Thatcher and Ramona Pierce, who also live in Cedar Crossing.</p><p>&#x201c;Sunday would be fine.&#x201d; Hannah&#x2019;s voice became low and urgent again. &#x201c;Unless you can come sooner. And please bring Ruby. I need to talk to both of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Frowning, I hung up and went to the door of the Crystal Cave. As usual, Ruby was burning her own handcrafted herbal incense, which creates a perfect backdrop for the tarot cards, rune stones, crystals, and books on astrology and the occult that she sells.</p><p>&#x201c;Want to drive over to Cedar Crossing on Sunday?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Ruby pushed a curl of henna-red hair out of her eyes and looked up from the stack of books she was shelving. &#x201c;Your plants are ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but that isn&#x2019;t why Hannah called. She wants to talk to us. It sounds like something&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby gave me a curious look. &#x201c;What do you suppose is going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said, feeling troubled. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll find out on Sunday.&#x201d;</p><p>But Hannah never got a chance to tell us what was bothering her. On Friday, I learned that she was dead.</p><p>&#x201c;A heart attack?&#x201d; Ruby asked, her eyes widening when I told her.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the newspaper says.&#x201d; I handed her the obituary that Ramona Pierce had clipped out of the Cedar Crossing Tattler and faxed to me. &#x201c;Apparently, she died the day after we talked. She&#x2019;s being buried tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What a shame,&#x201d; Ruby said sadly. &#x201c;Hannah was such a lovely, vibrant woman. I had no idea she had heart trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Neither had I.&#x201d; I frowned, thinking about the tone of Hannah&#x2019;s voice when she had said that she needed to talk to us, urgently. &#x201c;What would you think about going to Cedar Crossing anyway? I really would like to have those plants Hannah was saving for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;d like to see Ramona and Barbara,&#x201d; Ruby said in a decided tone. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>Cedar Crossing is a pretty village, built on the bank of the Guadalupe River. Its chief claim to fame is a simple white-painted church with a delicate steeple, built by the German settlers who established the town 150 years ago. Hannah&#x2019;s house and gardens were just down the road from the church. On Sunday afternoon, Ruby and I drove slowly past, admiring the sprays of bright foliage that spilled over the stone wall. The sunny yellow blooms of St. John&#x2019;s wort were brilliant against the feathery purple leaves of a tall bronze fennel, and golden-leaved feverfew splashed at the foot of a sprawling gray-blue Russian sage.</p><p>When I saw a woman pushing a wheelbarrow down the path, I pulled over and stopped. I studied her for a moment, then turned to Ruby. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to talk to her,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s pretend we don&#x2019;t know anything about Hannah&#x2019;s death.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby gave me a curious look. &#x201c;Why would we do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;Just a hunch, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby grinned. She is the kind of person who always trusts a hunch. &#x201c;Go for it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get that right brain in gear.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman behind the wheelbarrow was tanned and athletic-looking, with dark brown hair twisted into a loose, thick braid down her back. She wore a red bandana headband, a sweatshirt and jeans, and heavy garden gloves. Her face was stern and unsmiling.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said cheerfully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m China Bayles, and this is Ruby Wilcox.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman frowned. &#x201c;China Bayles. Aren&#x2019;t you the person who wanted some of Hannah&#x2019;s lemon thyme?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me. Hannah said we could pick up the plants anytime.&#x201d; I shaded my eyes with my hands and looked around. &#x201c;Is she here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hannah&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; The woman pressed her lips tightly together. &#x201c;She died early Wednesday morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby&#x2019;s hand went to her mouth. &#x201c;Oh, dear!&#x201d; she exclaimed, as if this were the first she&#x2019;d heard of it. &#x201c;An accident?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They say it was a heart attack.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice was taut, and she wasn&#x2019;t looking at us. &#x201c;The funeral was yesterday.&#x201d; She nodded in the direction of the church. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s buried in the churchyard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am so sorry,&#x201d; I said quietly. &#x201c;Hannah was a lovely person.&#x201d; I looked around the garden, which must have covered at least two acres. The fragrance of honeysuckle and roses surrounded us. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so sad to think that she won&#x2019;t be here to take care of this beautiful garden. I hope the next person who owns it will love it as much as she did.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s eyes flashed an enigmatic message. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of it,&#x201d; she said roughly. &#x201c;I promised Hannah I would.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Managing a garden this size is a big job,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It takes a lot of skill and knowledge. You really have to love it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why Hannah did what she did,&#x201d; the woman said. She turned toward the house and a look of something like hatred crossed her face. ``And no matter what they say,&#x201d; she burst out passionately, &#x201c;she wanted me to have it after she died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who do you suppose &#x2018;they&#x2019; are?&#x201d; Ruby whispered to me as the woman strode away, pushing her wheelbarrow. &#x201c;And who is she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; I said. I glanced toward the house. Another woman, short and plump and wearing a blue apron, was standing on the back porch, under the golden tangle of hops vines that covered the roof. At one time, Hannah had brewed her own beer, and had even given lectures on the subject.</p><p>The woman saw us and beckoned. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk to her,&#x201d; I said to Ruby. &#x201c;Maybe she knows what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must be China and Ruby,&#x201d; the woman said as we approached the porch. &#x201c;Aunt Hannah told me you might be here.&#x201d; She bit her lip. &#x201c;I suppose you know that she died several days ago.&#x201d;</p><p>The kitchen was almost as pretty as the garden, with a cheerful red-checked cloth on the table and windowsills filled with pots of scented geranium. The woman introduced herself as Luella Mitchell, Hannah&#x2019;s niece. As we sat at the table and sipped glasses of iced tea, she told us about the circumstances of Hannah&#x2019;s death.</p><p>&#x201c;It was very sudden,&#x201d; she said. Her round face was sad. &#x201c;And quite unexpected. I&#x2019;ve lived with my aunt for the past three years and even helped take care of her accounts, and I never even suspected that she had a bad heart.&#x201d; She sat down at the kitchen table and pulled a tissue out of her apron pocket to wipe her eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so hard to accept.&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned forward. &#x201c;Hannah told me that she wanted to talk to me about an urgent matter. She sounded terribly troubled. Do you know what was bothering her?&#x201d;</p><p>Luella&#x2019;s face tightened. &#x201c;I certainly do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She was afraid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Afraid?&#x201d; Ruby put down her glass.</p><p>&#x201c;Of that woman you were talking to, out there in the garden. Jessica Powell, her name is.&#x201d; Luella shook her head sadly. &#x201c;Jessica killed somebody once, you know. She spent a long time in jail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201d;She did?&#x201d; Ruby breathed.</p><p>Luella nodded soberly. &#x201c;Aunt Hannah realized that she&#x2019;d made a dangerous mistake, giving Jessica a job and letting her live in the garage apartment. And worse, putting her into her will. The woman has a green thumb, there&#x2019;s no doubt about that. But she moved in and just took over.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Why, she pushed poor Aunt Hannah right out of her own garden!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true, then, that Jessica Powell will inherit this place?&#x201d; I asked, remembering what the woman had said.</p><p>Luella&#x2019;s face was set. &#x201c;Aunt Hannah called you, China, because she wanted some legal advice. She&#x2019;d finally got up the courage to get rid of Jessica. But she died before she could change her will, so I guess &#x201d;</p><p>She was interrupted by a knock on the screen door. We turned to see two uniformed police officers standing on the porch.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for Miz Mitchell,&#x201d; one of them said through the screen. &#x201c;Hannah Bucher&#x2019;s niece.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Luella stood, her face suddenly apprehensive. &#x201c;Is there something the matter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Afraid so, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; The officer held out a paper. &#x201c;We have a warrant to search the residence of Jessica Powell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My apartment?&#x201d; Jessica Powell asked angrily. She had suddenly materialized beside the porch. &#x201c;What are you looking for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please show us your living quarters, Miz Powell,&#x201d; the officer said without answering her question. The two men followed her through the garden, in the direction of the two-story garage.</p><p>&#x201c;Why have they come?&#x201d; Luella asked in a bewildered voice. &#x201c;What are they looking for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Evidence,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t have gotten a warrant unless they had probable cause to suspect that Jessica Powell had committed a crime.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby&#x2019;s eyes were large. &#x201c;Murder?&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no!&#x201d; Luella exclaimed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s wrong! Aunt Hannah had a heart attack!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll just have to wait and see,&#x201d; I said grimly.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later the officers were back. Jessica Powell was with them, stony-faced and silent and handcuffed.</p><p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t understand!&#x201d; Luella exclaimed. &#x201c;Why are you arresting her? What&#x2019;s she done?&#x201d;</p><p>One officer gave her a sympathetic look. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, Miz Mitchell, but your aunt didn&#x2019;t die of natural causes. The autopsy report you requested indicates that she was poisoned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Poisoned!&#x201d; Luella whispered. &#x201c;But...but how? What kind of poison?&#x201d;</p><p>The other deputy held up a plastic evidence bag. &#x201c;Nicotine,&#x201d; he said. In the bag was a can of smoking tobacco.</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Nicotine poisoning?&#x201d; Ramona Pierce asked blankly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never heard of such a thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have,&#x201d; Barbara Thatcher said in a grim voice. &#x201c;Wicked stuff. Terribly toxic.&#x201d;</p><p>It was Sunday evening, and Ruby and I and our two hostesses were seated at the table in the dining room of Ramona and Barbara&#x2019;s home, finishing a wonderful dinner of fresh garden vegetables and penne pasta with herbs one of Barbara&#x2019;s specialty recipes. It was a pretty room, with a pair of French doors that opened out onto a patio bordered with rosemary, and the setting sun cast a golden light over Ramona&#x2019;s garden. The two women had bought the house together the previous year. Barbara practices law in San Antonio, and Ramona has her own interior decorating business.I nodded, agreeing with Barbara. &#x201c;Tobacco is toxic, all right. It&#x2019;s one of our most problematic herbs.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruby looked up from her plate. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying that tobacco is an herb?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a member of the nightshade family, like peppers, tomatoes, and eggplant and potatoes, too.&#x201d; I forked up a few veggies to demonstrate. &#x201c;Over the centuries, tobacco has been used to treat all kinds of ailments, including cancer. But it is most definitely toxic.&#x201d;</p><p>Ramona frowned. &#x201c;I know that cigarettes are bad news, but &#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just cigarettes,&#x201d; Barbara said. &#x201c;When I was in the DA&#x2019;s office, we prosecuted a case where the killer poisoned his victim with a nicotine-based pesticide.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gardeners sometimes brew up their own pesticide by steeping cigarettes in water,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Some people have been accidentally poisoned just by getting it on their hands.&#x201d;</p><p>Barbara looked at me curiously. &#x201c;So the police, acting on a tip, searched Jessica Powell&#x2019;s room?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And found the tobacco can,&#x201d; Ruby said. &#x201c;They think she made a nicotine concentrate and somehow administered it to Hannah. In her coffee, maybe, or in some strong-tasting food, like chili.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; Ramona asked, frowning. &#x201c;Everyone liked Hannah. We&#x2019;ll all miss her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because Jessica was the beneficiary of her will,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;And Hannah had become afraid of her and was planning to change it,&#x201d; Ruby explained. &#x201c;Jessica must have realized what Hannah had in mind, and decided to take action.&#x201d;</p><p>Barbara raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Hannah was planning to alter her will?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why she called China,&#x201d; Ruby explained. &#x201c;According to Luella Mitchell, her...</p></p><h2>Seekers #5: Fire in the Sky</h2><p><p>The spirits dance like fire in the sky. . . .</p><p>The three cubs&#x2014;Kallik, Toklo, and Lusa&#x2014;along with their shape-shifting companion, Ujurak, stand on the edge of the sea-ice under the blazing Northern Lights.

The poems address subjects ranging from the importance of &#34;sabbath&#34; moments in which nothing seems to happen and the love between two aged horses to Lavoisier&#39;s discovery of modern chemistry and the 1989 &#34;velvet revolutions&#34; of Eastern Europe. Grounded in a series of meditations upon the life of the feeling heart in the world - a heart envisioned as an almost independent being, whose own needs and desires require of us integration, acceptance, and finally praise - The October Palace is contemplative and sensuous, intellectual and emotional, philosophical and musical, and, above all, serious in its encounter with precisely experienced and deeply questioned life.<p>The author of five previous poetry collections and a book of essays, Jane Hirshfield has been a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and England&#x2019;s T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and she is the winner of the Poetry Center Book Award, the California Book Award, and fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations.

The poet trains to hear clearly and, as much as possible, without interruption, the voice of his or her mind, the voice that gathers, packs with meaning, and unpacks the language he or she knows. It can take a long time to learn to let this voice speak without getting in its way. This slow learning, the growth of this habit of inner attentiveness, is poetic development, and it is the substance of the poet&#x2019;s art. Of course, this growth is rarely steady, never linear, and is sometimes not actually growth but diminishment&#x2015;that&#x2019;s all part of the compelling story of a poet&#x2019;s way forward. </i><br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>&#x201c;The staggering thing about a life&#x2019;s work is it takes a lifetime to complete,&#x201d; Craig Morgan Teicher writes in these luminous essays. <i>We Begin in Gladness</i> considers how poets start out, how they learn to hear themselves, and how some offer us that rare, glittering thing: lasting work. Teicher traces the poetic development of the works of Sylvia Plath, John Ashbery, Louise Gl�ck, and Francine J. Harris, among others, to illuminate the paths they forged&#x2015;by dramatic breakthroughs or by slow increments, and always by perseverance. <i>We Begin in Gladness</i> is indispensable for readers curious about the artistic life and for writers wondering how they might light out&#x2015;or even scale the peak of the mountain.</p></p><p><b>Craig Morgan Teicher</b> is an acclaimed poet and critic.

He is the author of several nonfiction books including <i>Stalin's Children</i>,<i> Glorious Misadventures </i>and <i>An Impeccable Spy.</i><p><b>Prologue</b><br><br> The air-raid siren sounded at dawn. Its rising wail was relayed across the sleeping town by loudspeakers mounted on lampposts, in the corridors of dormitories and barracks, and in the entrance halls of laboratories and workshops. It reverberated from the abandoned church belfry that faced Lenin Square, sending flights of startled pigeons up into the gray October morning. The birds wheeled over the rooftops of the old town center, over the new parks and apartment buildings, over guard towers and the three concentric rings of barbed wire. Finally they flapped over the dark forest that encircled the secret city of Arzamas-16 like a sea.<br><br> In the main machine hall, the whining lathes slowed to a whir. Banks of fluorescent lights snapped off, leaving the operators blinking in morning light that filtered through the glass roof. In the parachute workshop, needles nodded to a halt between the seamstresses&#x2019; spread fingers. The women straightened stiffly, grateful for the weekly air-raid drill and an early end to their night shift. In the blueprint room, tousled young engineers swept Lucite rulers and set-squares off their drawing tables, rolled plans into long asbestos tubes, and clattered down the stairs toward a row of fireproof safes.<br><br> Fifty meters below their feet, a squad of soldiers ran, crooked with sleep, to their battle stations outside the main warhead vault. White-coated men filed out of the bunker chatting, patting pockets for matches and cigarettes. Behind them they left orderly rows of lead canisters stacked in cubicles, a large steel hemisphere sprouting wires, vessels of dull metal as big as bathtubs. Once the last of the scientists had exited, the soldiers hauled the steel blast door shut behind them. Their commanding officer rolled the bolts home with a soft clang.<br><br> Alone in its secret vault, deep in the bowels of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, the bomb they called RDS-220 stood alone in silence and darkness.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> On his blood-soaked sheets, Fyodor Petrov did not stir. He heard the siren&#x2019;s wail as a rising swell on the furthest edge of his consciousness. All night he had been rafting across a sea of pain, rolled by nausea. Liquid fire was consuming his body.<br><br> Now, Petrov saw light. He remembered that light has mass, and exerts pressure. A physical pressure, tiny but measurable. He seemed to feel its particles as they fell on the skin of his face, streaming toward him from the surface of the sun. He tried to rise against the light, but his young body would not obey him. He willed one hand into motion. It jerked spastically as it crawled up his torso. His face was stuck to his pillow. His fingers scraped at a tacky, fibrous mass under his cheek and raised a pinch to his unfocused eyes. His own blond hair, shed in the night, matted with blood and vomit.<br><br> &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t die,&#x201d; Petrov heard his own voice argue. &#x201c;If I die, I will never know.&#x201d;<br><br> Petrov let his hand drop. Numb darkness spread over him.<br><br> He dreamt of fire, consuming the world in a furious tornado. He saw the proud towers of the Kremlin torn from their foundations, disintegrating into ziggurats of dust. He saw boiling seas and bend�ing forests exploding into flame. The whole earth burning, at his command.<br><br> The faces of his teachers, friends, and comrades rose before him. They were arguing among themselves, but he could not understand what they were saying. Lost deep inside himself, Petrov felt the out�side world dissolve. The flesh that had clung to him so tortuously all night finally fell away. He had become a spirit, rising vertiginously into space with a cold wind rushing on his face. Delivered at last into infinite peace, a billion stars inside his head blazed into light.<br><br> The siren stopped. And with it, so did Fyodor Petrov&#x2019;s weak human heart. <br> &nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Give the Devil His Due (Rowland Sinclair WWII Mysteries, 7)</h2><p><p><strong>This adventure-packed romp threads between 1934 Sydney's upper class and its seedy underworld.</strong></p><p>Wealthy Rowland Sinclair, an artist with leftist friends and a free-wheeling lifestyle, reluctantly agrees to a charity race.

In fact, that presence extends to the baseball commissioner Bud Selig, labor leaders Marvin Miller and Don Fehr, owners Jerry Reinsdorf and Stuart Sternberg, officials Theo Epstein and Mark Shapiro, sportswriters Murray Chass, Ross Newhan, Ira Berkow, and Roger Kahn, and even famous Jewish baseball fans like Alan Dershowitz and Barney Frank.&nbsp; </p><p>The life stories of these and many others, on and off the field, have been compiled from nearly fifty in-depth interviews and arranged by decade in this edifying and entertaining work of oral and cultural history. In <i>American Jews and America&#x2019;s Game</i> each person talks about growing up Jewish and dealing with Jewish identity, assimilation, intermarriage, future viability, religious observance, anti-Semitism, and Israel. Each tells about being in the midst of the colorful pantheon of players who, over the past seventy-five years or more, have made baseball what it is. Their stories tell, as no previous book has, the history of the larger-than-life role of Jews in America&#x2019;s pastime.</p></p><p>Larry Ruttman, Fellow of the Massachusetts Historical Society,&nbsp;is the author of <i>Voices of Brookline</i>, a national finalist for the Award of Merit of the American Association of State and Local History.

As she moves through the world navigating banal, familiar, and sometimes uncomfortable interactions with the familiar-faced strangers she sees daily, Williams weaves together a riveting collection of flashbacks. Her recollections highlight the indefinable moments when lines are crossed and a woman must ask herself if the only way to avoid being objectified is to simply cease to draw any attention to her physical being. She delves into the gray space that lives between consent and assault and tenderly explores the complexity of the shame, guilt, vulnerability, and responsibility attached to both. </p></p><p><b>Erin Williams </b>is a writer, illustrator, and researcher living in New York.

He finds society's "perfect darlings" exceedingly boring. But there's something intriguing, and not quite perfect, about faultless Lady Charlotte Hayward. He senses a crack under her polished surface, and finding it is a challenge he can't resist.</p><p>Immovable Object</p><p>Lady Charlotte is so beautiful, charming, and gracious that no one has noticed what an expert she is at Not Getting Married. Early on, she learned a painful lesson about trust . . . and temptation. In the years since, she's devoted her life to being all she <em>ought</em> to be&#x2014;and she's not about to let a man like Carsington entice her to do everything she shouldn't.</p><p>A Splendid Collision</p><p>But the rules of attraction can easily overpower the rules of manners and morals, and sometimes even the best-behaved girl has to follow her instincts, even if it means risking it all.</p></p><p><p>Loretta Chase has worked in academe, retail, and the visual arts, as well as on the streets&#x2014;as a meter maid&#x2014;and in video, as a scriptwriter.

Handsome, charming and an intellectual of the first order, Darius Carsington, fifth son of the earl of Hargate, spends his life in two pursuits: "(1) studying animal behavior, especially breeding and mating behavior, and (2) devoting his leisure hours to emulating this behavior"&#x2014;with women. But his demanding father finds Darius's interests worthless and gives him a choice: either marry or go to work renovating his father's recently acquired countryside estate. Darius chooses the latter, making him neighbors with Lady Charlotte Hayward, a beautiful woman who's vowed never to marry, and the young pair's clumsy, comical first meeting does nothing to diminish the immediate chemistry between them. Behind her vow, though, Charlotte hides a shameful 10-year-old secret that she's loathe to reveal&#x2014;and which a marriage would surely uncover&#x2014;but nonetheless finds herself falling hard for Darius. Meanwhile, Darius is struggling to maintain his longstanding belief that there's no such thing as love. Amid all the reluctance, trysts and unexpected devotion, a hidden rival steps up to capture Charlotte and threaten to expose her. Chase knows what her fans want&#x2014;strong characters, a swift pace and plenty of heated encounters&#x2014;and once again she delivers, with considerable wit. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unlike other histories of rock, Before Elvis offers a far broader and deeper analysis of the influences on rock music. Dispelling common misconceptions, it examines rock&#x2019;s origins in hokum songs and big-band boogies as well as Delta blues, detailing the embrace by white artists of African-American styles long before rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll appeared. This unique study ranges far and wide, highlighting not only the contributions of obscure but key precursors like Hardrock Gunter and Sam Theard but also the influence of celebrity performers like Gene Autry and Ella Fitzgerald.<br><br>Too often, rock historians treat the genesis of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll as a bolt from the blue, an overnight revolution provoked by the bland pop music that immediately preceded it and created through the white appropriation of music till then played only by and for black audiences. In Before Elvis, Birnbaum daringly argues a more complicated history of rock&#x2019;s evolution from a heady mix of ragtime, boogie-woogie, swing, country music, mainstream pop, and rhythm-and-blues&#x2014;a melange that influenced one another along the way, from the absorption of blues and boogies into jazz and pop to the integration of country and Caribbean music into rhythm-and-blues.<br><br>Written in an easy style, Before Elvis presents a bold argument about rock&#x2019;s origins and required reading for fans and scholars of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll history.</p><p>For some 35 years, Larry Birnbaum has written for periodicals ranging from Down Beat to the New York Times and edited books and magazines about music.As the subtitle implies, music journalist Birnbaum approaches the history of rock and roll like an archaeologist. Instead of cave paintings or crudely made tools, Birnbaum has records&#x2014;lots and lots of records. Unlike most music histories, which tend to focus on performers and their lives, Birnbaum investigates sounds: Where did these rhythms come from? Where did this riff start? The tracing of musical and lyrical memes makes for a consuming, if at times overwhelming, journey through mid-20th-century American pop culture history. Birnbaum&#x2019;s knowledge of the music of this time period is breathtaking, and will make readers wish the book came with a soundtrack....Still, this corrective to what so many of music fans assume they know about rock and pop history is a necessary one and will introduce readers to artists deserving greater attention. This stunning tour de force of prerock history will inspire fans to learn more about the roots of the music they love. (<i>Library Journal, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>This is an incredible deep dive into the history of rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll by way of jazz, country, and blues. Here is how I read the book: I slid my headphones on, dialed up Spotify, and looked up as many of the artists or songs a Birnbaum discussed. Talk about an education! (<i>Music Tomes</i>)<br><br>Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock 'n' Roll is an exemplary work of musical history, combining substantial new research with previously established material for a comprehensive vision of a previously fragmented field. Having a grasp of American music and its sources even pre-dating arrival in America, Birnbaum fulfills his promise of showing how rock 'n' roll after the rise of Elvis Presley was a natural outgrowth of the diversified society which preceded him. Attentive to commercial realities and the complex lives of musical artists, conversant with the musical motifs and lyric themes of the popular music world in both recorded and live-performance, Larry Birnbaum paints a world inhabited by working artists who are fully conscious of their sources, influences and efforts at personal expression, naturally reaching for audiences ever eager for the new twist on a familiar tune. This is a significant work, rich with revelations. (Howard Mandel, author of Miles, Ornette, Cecil: Jazz Beyond Jazz and president of the Jazz Journalists Association)<br><br>I am jealous of Larry Birnbaum, for he seems to have heard every record ever made. Consequently he is one of those rare people who understands that rock'n'roll did not spring suddenly out of the brain of some fevered disc jockey, and his book is a rollicking ride through the vernacular music of several decades before 'Heartbreak Hotel'. (Donald Clarke, author, Penguin Encyclopedia of Popular Music; Wishing on the Moon: The Life and Times of Billie Holiday; The Rise and Fall of Popular Music; and All or Nothing at all: A Life of Frank Sinatra)<br><br>This analysis is just one example of the iconoclastic thinking that makes Mr. Birnbaum's book invaluable. His good ear and deep original research help him overturn much of the conventional wisdom about where rock came from.... The author ends by lamenting that "the definitive study of rock 'n' roll origins has yet to be written." It seems clear that with the present volume, a damned good start has been made. (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Birnbaum (a music journalist) has drawn on his encyclopedic knowledge in this history of popular music in much of the 20th century. He expands and updates the coverage in Ed Ward, Geoffrey Stokes, and Ken Tucker's Rock of Ages: The Rolling Stone History of Rock and Roll (CH, Jun'87) and Robert Palmer's Rock and Roll: An Unruly History (1995), Charlie Gillett's The Sound of the City (1971), and Chuck Mancuso's heavily illustrated Popular Music and the Underground (1996). The author begins by observing that "the nascent sound of rock n' roll could be heard as early as the 1920s in a number of hokum songs, piano boogies, and jazz-band arrangements," and this finally emerged full-blown with Elvis Presley in the mid-1950s. After two introductory chapters, Birnbaum moves into detailed discussions of the blues, boogie-woogie, jazz, country music, and rhythm and blues, and concludes with Frankie Laine, Kay Starr, Johnnie Ray, and Pat Boone. Each chapter offers detailed information on the performers, songs, record companies, and much more. Birnbaum also provides some technical information on the songs and arrangements. This rich discussion is accompanied by detailed notes that draw on the latest research. Summing Up: Highly recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>"Rock 'n' Roll is just the blues sped up." That statement might have satisfied a generation of listeners who barely scratched beneath the surface of the genre, looking for its source. And it may have been propagated by a generation of wide-eyed romantics the same way the myth of Robert Johnson was. But it, in no way, satisfied writer Larry Birnbaum, who has penned the definitive history of American music leading up to rock. Believe this: Birnbaum is the music geek Wotan. He has listened to every recording since Edison cylinders were popular. (<i>All About Jazz</i>)<br><br>[A]n awe-inspiring journey from wax cylinder recordings, negro work songs and African slave spirituals through to early 20th century shellac records and music that has not been transferred onto the modern CD format.... Larry Birnbaum offers us a huge X-Ray of a full catalogue of unsung heroes, buried by the history written from an angle that has everyone believing that rock'n'roll music developed strictly from blues and country music. The author digs into hokum, swing, rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, doo-wop and jump blues, among many other genres, to uncover the true roots of rock'n'roll. (<i>ClickZoomBytes</i>)<br><br>Birnbaum's book is chock-full of material [covering the] blues, country, minstrel music, doo wop, big band jump, early rhythm and blues, jive and an overlooked genre that he considers of premium importance, hokum music. All of these, he proves, led to rock. Before Elvis is a fascinating book that should be both in every academic library and on every music lover's shelves. Where else are you going to find out what Harry "the Hipster" Gibson contributed to rock 'n' roll? (<i>Rambles.NET</i>)<br><br>So, you think you know all there is to know about rock and roll. Nope, not even close. Let Larry Birnbaum set you straight. His 400-page plus book Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll is the definitive word on where our beloved rock music came from, who made it, and how many of those rumors we thought were true aren&#x2019;t. ... Birnbaum presents Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll less like a tired, old history book and more like a living breathing jumpin&#x2019; and jivin&#x2019; story. Yes, there are lots of facts, but in general, this book is a fun read. In other words, nobody&#x2019;s going to test you on what you learn here, so just sit back and enjoy the lesson. Learn about Lloyd Price&#x2019;s career. Read about how specific techniques like the walking bass line became so popular. Discover those under-the-radar guitar slingers. There really isn&#x2019;t any part of the rock and roll story that Birnbaum doesn&#x2019;t get to and that&#x2019;s really what I like most about this book. The author feels his readers need to know it all, and he&#x2019;s researched it well. (<i>Vintage Rock</i>)</p><h2>My Scotland</h2><p><p><i>'I love stories.

This history of the Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla people had its beginnings in October 2000, when elders sat side by side with native students and native and non-native scholars to compare notes on tribal history and culture. Through this collaborative process, tribal members of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation have taken on their own historical retellings, drawing on the scholarship of non-Indians as a useful tool and external resource.<br><br>Primary to this history are native voices telling their own story. Beginning with ancient teachings and traditions, moving to the period of first contact with Euro-Americans, the Treaty council, war, and the reservation period, and then to today's modern tribal governance and the era of self-determination, the tribal perspective takes center stage. Throughout, readers will see continuity in the culture and in ways of life that have been present from the earliest times, all on the same landscape.<br><br>Wiyaxayxt (Columbia River Sahaptin) and Wiyaakaa'awn (Nez Perce) can be interpreted to mean "as the days go by," "day by day," or "daily living."

A to N (SdKfz 141) (Owners&#39; Workshop Manual)</h2><p><p>When Hitler unleashed Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 1941, the 23-tonne Panzer III was in the vanguard of the German assault. The German Panzer III tank (official designation Panzerkampfwagen III, Sd Kfz 141, abbreviated to PzKpfw III) saw widespread use during the Second World War campaigns in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and the Balkans, and in North Africa with the famous Afrika Korps. A small number were still in use in Normandy (1944), at Anzio (1943), in Norway and Finland and in Operation Market Garden (1944). Some 5,774 were built between 1937 and 1943. Although the Panzer III was conceived to operate alongside the infantry-supporting Panzer IV to fight other tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, the roles were reversed when the German Army came up against the formidable Soviet T-34 tank. A tank with a more powerful anti-tank gun was needed so the Panzer IV with its larger turret ring and long-barrelled 7.5cm KwK 40 gun was used in tank-versus-tank battles, with the Panzer III being redeployed in the infantry support role. Production of the Panzer III ended in 1943, although its dependable chassis provided hulls for the Sturmgeschutz III (StuG III) assault gun, one of the most successful of the war, until the end of the war. Centrepiece of the Haynes Panzer III Tank Manual is the Bovington Tank Museum's PzKpfw III Ausf L, which has been restored to running condition. This tank belonged to the same battalion as the museum's famous Tiger I (the 501st (Heavy) Panzer Abteilung) and is an early production Ausf L, modified for tropical service. It was shipped via Naples to Benghazi in Libya in July 1942 and was issued to the 8th Panzer Regiment, part of the 15th Panzer Division and probably fought in the Battle of Alam Halfa. It was subsequently captured by the British Army and shipped to the UK.The Tank Museum has restored the tank to running order, has repainted it in its original camouflage and markings and is currently replacing many of the ancillary tools and equipment that it carried.</p></p><p><p><b>Mike Hayton</b> was closely involved in the restoration of the Tank Museum's Panzer III to running order and is co-author of the Haynes <i>Tiger Tank Manual</i>.</p><p><b>Dick Taylor</b> is a former British Army Challenger tank commander and now works fulltime as an author specialising in armoured fighting vehicles.

The Third Reich restores a broad perspective and intellectual unity to issues that have become academic subspecialties and offers a brilliant new interpretation of Hitler's evil rule.</p><p>Filled with human and moral considerations that are missing from theoretical accounts, Michael Burleigh's book gives full weight to the experience of ordinary people who were swept up in, or repelled by, Hitler's movement and emphasizes international themes-for Nazi Germany appealed to many European nations, and its wartime conduct included efforts to dominate the Continental economy and involved gigantic population transfers and exterminations, recruitment of foreign labor, and multinational armies.</p></p><p>Humans have a fascination with evil. We long to identify it, quantify it, and understand it. To this end, newspapers frequently splash photographs of murderers with the caption "The face of evil." Heading most lists of the 20th century's most evil people would be Adolf Hitler, but, as Michael Burleigh's tour de force makes clear, evil is not always as cut-and-dried as we would like. The Nazis could not have come to power and committed Germany to a policy of war and genocide without the tacit consent of the German people. This makes Germany as a whole responsible for the crimes committed in its name, but it is clearly wrong to label every German as evil. Through his painstaking research and direct prose, Burleigh slowly builds up a picture of a people desperate for identity and economic prosperity, who, bit by bit, closed off their conscience as the price of their dreams. There was no one cathartic moment when Germany, under the Third Reich, lapsed from goodness into badness; rather, there was an incremental realignment of a collective morality. Burleigh's explanation of this phenomenon is so simple, yet so obviously right, that you can only wonder that it didn't become the generally accepted currency years ago.<p> Instead of viewing Nazi Germany in purely social, political, and economic terms--though he doesn't ignore these spheres--Burleigh wraps them all into a picture of a country gripped in a religious, messianic fervor, and that which had previously felt inexplicable suddenly seems clear. If you want the nitty-gritty details of the Second World War and the genocide, they are here, retold as well as, if not better than, many of the other histories of this period. But it's Burleigh's take on the people of Germany that makes this book so special. Above all, with similar genocidal wars currently being fought in Kosovo, Rwanda, and Iraq, it makes you think, "Would I be able to resist becoming complicit in such regimes?" This is a must for every 20th-century historian. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><b>Michael Burleigh</b>, William R.

Through a series of highly original historical studies, Habermas reexamines the relations between philosophy, science and politics. Beginning with the classical doctrine of politics as developed by Aristotle, he traces the changing constellation of theory and practice through the work of Machiavelli, More, Hobbes, Hegel and Marx. He argues that, with the development of the modern sciences, politics has become increasingly regarded as a technical discipline concerned with problems of prediction and control. Politics has thus lost its link with the practical cultivation of character, that is, with the praxis of enlightened citizens. Theory and Practices includes a major reassessment of Marx&#39;s work and of the status of Marxism as a form of critique. In an important concluding chapter Habermas examines the role of reason and the prospects for critical theory in our modern scientific civilization.</p><p>J�rgen Habermas (born June 18, 1929) is a German sociologist and philosopher in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Runner (China Thrillers)</h2><p>A top Chinese swimmer kills himself on the eve of an international event.

Beijing detective Li Yan finds himself in charge of what could be his last investigation for the Chines police. Li&#39;s only hope of a breakthrough is a champion runner, the sole member of the athletics team who seems willing to talk. But she will only talk to American pathologist Margaret Campbell - and now, the runner has disappeared.

He spent six months in China, much of it researching his first novel, The Firemaker.Simon Vance&#39;s performance will leave listeners breathless in the fifth episode of Peter May&#39;s China series. Vance brings his superior narrating skills to May&#39;s police procedural starring the detective team of Li Yan, chief of the Beijing Municipal Police, and Margaret Campbell, a forensic pathologist who is Li Yan&#39;s American fianc�e. China&#39;s top athletes are being murdered. Three members of China&#39;s sprint-relay team, a cyclist, a top swimmer, and a world-class weight lifter are dead. A female runner appeals to Margaret, fearing she will be next. Vance is splendid in this engrossing story of Beijing life, internal police politics, Chinese Triads, genetic research, and brutal megalomaniacs who stop at nothing to succeed-not even murder.

He is famous; everybody remembers his remarks. . . . We forget that there were other family members at the table&#x2014;a quiet person, now muffled by time, shadowy, whose heart pounded with love, perhaps, or rage.&#x201d; So begins <i>The True History of the First Mrs. Meredith and Other Lesser Lives</i>, an uncommon biography devoted to one of those &#x201c;lesser lives.&#x201d; As the author points out, &#x201c;A lesser life does not seem lesser to the person who leads one.&#x201d; Such sympathy and curiosity compelled Diane Johnson to research Mary Ellen Peacock Meredith (1821&#x2013;1861), the daughter of the famous artist Thomas Love Peacock (1785&#x2013;1866) and first wife of the equally famous poet George Meredith (1828&#x2013;1909). Her life, treated perfunctorily and prudishly in biographies of Peacock or Meredith, is here exquisitely and unhurriedly given its due. What emerges is the portrait of a brilliant, well-educated woman, raised unconventionally by her father only to feel more forcefully the constraints of the Victorian era. First published in 1972, <i>Lesser Lives </i>has been a key text for feminists and biographers alike, a book that reimagined what biography might be, both in terms of subject and style. Biographies of other &#x201c;lesser&#x201d; lives have since followed in its footsteps, but few have the wit, elegance, and empathy of Johnson&#x2019;s seminal work.</p><p><b>Diane Johnson</b> is a novelist and critic.

One-niner-four-seven. Two engines and a ladder from the 499, responding.<br> <br>Or, put another way, Anne Ashburn&#x2019;s Friday night date had showed up on time and was taking her to a show. Granted, &#x201c;on time&#x201d; was the precise moment she had sat down for a meal at the stationhouse with her crew, and the &#x201c;show&#x201d; was a warehouse fire they were going to have to chorus-line for. But if you judged the health of a relationship on its constancy and whether it brought purpose and meaning to your life?<br> <br>Then this firefighting gig was the best damn partner a woman could ask for.<br> <br>As Engine Co. 17 turned the corner onto Harbor with siren and lights going, Anne glanced around the shallow seating area of the apparatus. There were four jump seats behind the cab, two forward-facing, two rear-, the pairs separated by an aisle of gear. Emilio &#x201c;Amy&#x201d; Chavez and Patrick &#x201c;Duff&#x201d; Duffy were on one side. She and Daniel &#x201c;Dannyboy&#x201d; Maguire were on the other. Up in front, Deshaun &#x201c;Doc&#x201d; Lewis, the engineer, was behind the wheel, and Captain Christopher &#x201c;Chip&#x201d; Baker, the incident commander, was shotgun.<br> <br>Her nickname was &#x201c;Sister.&#x201d; Which was what happened when you were the sibling of the great Fire Chief Thomas Ashburn, Jr., and the daughter of the revered&#x2014;falsely as it turned out&#x2014;Thomas Ashburn, Sr.<br> <br>Not everybody called her that, though.<br> <br>She focused on Danny. He was staring out the open window, the cold November wind blowing his black hair back, his exhausted blue eyes focused on nothing. In their bulky turnouts, their knees brushed every time the engine bumped over sewer-access panels, potholes, manholes, intersections.<br> <br>Okay, okay, she wanted to say to fate. I know he&#x2019;s there. You don&#x2019;t have to keep reminding me.<br> <br>The hardheaded bastard was a lot of things, most of which carried terms you couldn&#x2019;t use around your grandmother, but he knew she hated the &#x201c;Sister&#x201d; thing, so to him, she was Ashburn.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d also called her Anne&#x2014;once. Late at night about three weeks ago.<br> <br>Yes, they had been naked at the time. Oh, God . . . had they finally done that?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna beat you at pong,&#x201d; he said without looking at her. &#x201c;Soon as we get back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No chance.&#x201d; She hated that he knew she&#x2019;d been staring at him. &#x201c;All talk, Dannyboy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; He turned to face her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you win, how about that?&#x201d;<br> <br>His smile was slow, knowing, evil. And her temper answered the phone on the first ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;The hell you will.&#x201d; Anne leaned forward. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t play with you if you cheat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even if it benefits you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not winning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh. Well, you&#x2019;ll have to explain to me the ins and outs of it when we&#x2019;re back at the house. While I&#x2019;m beating you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anne shook her head and glared out the open window.<br> <br>The first tap on her leg she ascribed to a bump in the road. The second, third, and fourth were obviously&#x2014;<br> <br>She looked back at Danny. &#x201c;Stop it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you twelve?&#x201d; As he started to smile, she knew exactly where his mind had gone. &#x201c;Not inches. Age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I peak more like at sixteen.&#x201d; He lowered his voice. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Between the sirens and the open windows, no one else could hear them&#x2014;and Danny never pulled the double entendre if there was a risk of that. But yes, Anne now knew intimately all of his heavily muscled and tattooed anatomy. Granted, it had been only that once.<br> <br>Then again, unforgettable only had to happen one time.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re out of your mind,&#x201d; she muttered.<br> <br>And then they were at the scene. The old 1900s-era warehouse was a shell of its former useful self, sixty-five thousand square feet of broken glass panes, rotting beams, and blown-off roof panels. The outer walls were brick, but based on the age, the floors and any room dividers inside were going to be wood. The blaze was in the northeast corner on the second floor, billowing smoke wafting up into the forty-degree night air before being carried away by a southerly wind.<br> <br>As Anne&#x2019;s boots hit the ground, she pulled the top half of her turnouts closed. Her ponytail was up high on the back of her head, and she stripped out the band, reorganized the shoulder length, and cranked things tight at her nape. The brown was still streaked with blond from the summer, but she needed to get it trimmed&#x2014;so all that lightness was on the chopping block.<br> <br>Of course, if she were a woman &#x201c;who took care of herself,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d get it highlighted through the winter months. Or so her mother liked to tell her. But who the hell had time for that?<br> <br>&#x201c;Sister, you sweep the place with Amy for addicts,&#x201d; Captain Baker commanded. &#x201c;Stay away from that corner. Danny and Duff, run those lines!&#x201d;<br> <br>As Captain Baker continued to bark orders out, she turned away. She had her assignment. Until she completed it, or there was an insurmountable obstacle or change of order, she was required to execute that directive and no other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be safe in there, Ashburn.&#x201d;<br> <br>The words were soft and low, meant for her ears alone. And as she glanced over her shoulder, Danny&#x2019;s Irish eyes were not smiling.<br> <br>A ripple of premonition made her rub the back of her neck. &#x201c;Yeah, you, too, Maguire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Piece&#x2019;a cake. We&#x2019;ll be back at pong before ten.&#x201d;<br> <br>They walked away from each other at the same time, Danny going around to the stacks of hoses in the back, her linking up with Chavez. She liked being paired with Emilio. He was a four-year veteran who was built like an SUV and had the brains of a Jeopardy! contestant. He also did what he said he was going to do with no drama.<br> <br>Godsend, really.<br> <br>The two of them went to a compartment on the outside of the truck, threw up the protective metal panel, and grabbed for their air tanks. After pulling her hood over her head, she Velcro&#x2019;d and buckled her jacket and loaded her oxygen source onto her back. She let the mask hang loose and put her helmet on.<br> <br>Moving forward on the truck flank, they opened another compartment, and she strapped a hand axe on her hip and added her radio and a box light. When Emilio was ready, the pair of them gloved up and jogged across the frosted scruff grass, hopping over a debris salad of rusted-out car parts, random pieces of building, and weathered trash. The flashing red lights of the trucks made bulky shadows out of their graceless movements, and the clean air going in and out of her throat was the kind of thing she made sure to enjoy.<br> <br>It was going to be a while before she had it again.<br> <br>As they came up to a side door, the knob was locked, but the panels were loose as a bad fighter&#x2019;s front teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got it,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Turning a shoulder in, she threw her weight into the flimsy barrier, busting it wide open. As splinters fell in a clatter, she triggered the light beam on her helmet and looked inside. Not what she expected&#x2014;which was the norm. You never knew what a building&#x2019;s interior was going to look like for sure until you got a peek at it, and instead of one cavernous space, she and Emilio were in a makeshift hall. Offices, narrow and short-ceilinged, opened off it, the repurposing transforming the warehouse into a den for administrators of some sort. Or telemarketers. Or day traders.<br> <br>Of course, whatever it was had been a going concern a good ten years ago. Now, the place was uninhabitable.<br> <br>She and Emilio took opposite sides, and as they progressed, she checked out a lot of old office equipment from the Ally McBeal era. Everything was busted up, water-stained, and covered with grunge, which explained why it hadn&#x2019;t been looted.<br> <br>No scent of the fire. No heat. But the air was not clear.<br> <br>The smell of rot, urine, and mold was dense as a solid.<br> <br>They made quick time, going through the maze. As they went along, their radios kept them updated, the alternating hiss and talk the kind of thing she took in without being aware of hearing it.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;wind changing. Northeast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;getting that roof ventilation opened now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>In the back of her mind, she noted the former, but didn&#x2019;t worry about it. The blaze had been small, the engine was on it with a good water source charging the lines, and they had plenty of ladder access from above. Plus, the place was so big, she and Emilio were a mile away from the hot spot.<br> <br>As they came up to a staircase, she stopped. &#x201c;You take the second floor, I&#x2019;ll keep going.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no protocol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason to stay together. The fire&#x2019;s all the way over there&#x2014;it&#x2019;s more efficient.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you suggesting I can&#x2019;t handle myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emilio shook his head. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll take upstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll join you soon as I&#x2019;m through down here. There&#x2019;s one more corner to go, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Emilio headed up the tight, jury-rigged steps, she continued on. The farther she went, the more mold compromised the air quality, but she had thirty minutes of oxygen on her back&#x2014;fifteen if she were exerting herself&#x2014;and she wasn&#x2019;t going to waste it on a bad smell.<br> <br>Up ahead, something flashed across the corridor, the figure scrambling in the darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; she called out as she took off after the person.<br> <br>Anne went left, right, hit a straightaway, her lungs working, thighs churning, equipment bouncing on her body. In the helmet&#x2019;s jumping beam, the man or woman went in and out of phase with the illumination, a ghost dressed in rags.<br> <br>They ended up in a shallow room with no door, no window, nothing but the archway they both entered through. The vagrant was muddy as a hound, his hair so matted he had tails growing out of his head. His breathing worried her. Very labored. And that flush, too. He was on something, and probably had pneumonia.<br> <br>She put her gloved hands up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the police. I just want you out so you don&#x2019;t get hurt&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201d; he panted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fucking kill you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Stepping away, she put one hand on her short axe. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you&#x2019;re on, or why you&#x2019;re in here. There&#x2019;s a fire in the building behind us. Do you know where the ways out are?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go then. I won&#x2019;t stop you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going back to jail!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cool. I&#x2019;m fire, not police. But you have to get out of the building&#x2014;if only because the cops will show up here soon. If you don&#x2019;t want to be arrested, leave now. I&#x2019;m not in your way.&#x201d;<br> <br>The vagrant took off, streaking past her and running flat out in his mismatched boot-and-shoe combo. If he had been saveable, she would have played a different card. But she was not going to get hurt trying to convince someone they needed help, and she wasn&#x2019;t going to waste time vouching for rehab and treatment when there might be somebody who was in medical distress two doors farther down.<br> <br>Three minutes later, she was at the far end of the building. &#x201c;First floor cleared,&#x201d; she said into her radio.<br> <br>As she came back to the stairwell, she got her initial scent of smoke, that change in wind direction blowing the fire into its source of combustibles instead of away from it&#x2014;<br> <br>Bam!<br> <br>The frontal impact was so quick and hard, she got blown backward off her boots, her body landing on her tank as gravity took her to the ground. With the air punched out of her lungs, her vision flickered, and she heard another of those vagrants disappear at a dead run.<br> <br>Rolling off her air cylinder, she braced herself on all fours and looked at the wake of what had hit her. All she caught was a black shape disappearing around the corner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sonofabitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a groan, she got back to vertical and took a couple of deep breathers. Pain was registering on her spine, but other than that case of the owies, she was okay.<br> <br>No reason to go after that addict. He or she had gotten the GTFO memo.<br> <br>Pivoting around, her beam flashed along the graffiti&#x2019;d wall and then penetrated the stairwell. Emilio must have flushed the person down from the second floor&#x2014;<br> <br>The explosion was so loud, her ears lacked the capacity to accommodate it as sound. Pain was what registered, and covering her head and going into a crouch was both instinctual and part of training. Her immediate thought was meth lab. They&#x2019;d had something similar the month before, with the chemicals used to make the drug blowing a two-story duplex sky-high.<br> <br>She grabbed for her radio. &#x201c;Emilio. Are you clear? Emilio&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; he said over the connection. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m way off in southwest corner, second floor. What was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Thank God, she thought. She did not want to lose him&#x2014;<br> <br>The rumble overhead started as a creak and a rattle. It did not stay that way. The collapse was as unexpected as it was fast, all kinds of heavy and hard landing on top of her, an avalanche of God only knew what raining blows on her body.<br> <br>And then flames were everywhere.<br> <br>Crushed under debris, pinned to the concrete floor, and without her air mask on, Anne had only one thought.<br> <br>All her life, she had been determined to follow in her father&#x2019;s footsteps.<br> <br>Now it looked as if she might die in the same way he had.</p><h2>The Cat, the Vagabond and the Victim (Cats in Trouble Mystery)</h2><p><b>Things get hairy when a cat finds multiple bodies in this mystery in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Cats in Trouble series.</b><br><br>When Clyde the cat travels two hundred miles back home only to find his former owner dead, the story makes national news.

But my friend Allison Cuddahee from the local no-kill shelter had called me in a panic to ask a favor. She arrived thirty minutes later bearing a gift.</p><p>The opportunity to foster a cat is always a gift as far as I&#x2019;m concerned. This particular feline&#x2019;s name was Clyde, and I already knew he was a celebrity. The press was onto him and his amazing story. See, various out-of-town reporters had been hanging around the Mercy Animal Sanctuary, hoping for photo opportunities. That was why Allison resorted to this late-night, stealthy delivery. I guess you could now call my home his &#x201c;undisclosed location.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m Jillian Hart, I live in Mercy, South Carolina, and I have a history of helping cats. After all, my three beauties&#x2014;Syrah, Merlot and Chablis&#x2014;are all Hurricane Katrina rescues. I found each of them in different shelters in the Houston area where I once lived. They&#x2019;d been removed from flood-ravaged New Orleans and remained unclaimed months after the storm. But my now-late husband, John, and I gladly gave them a new forever home. I wondered how they&#x2019;d get along with Clyde, who was being surprisingly quiet in the crate Allison set at her feet in my foyer.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for stepping up again, Jillian,&#x201d; Allison said. &#x201c;We sneaked Clyde out the back door of the shelter and into my car because two particularly pesky reporters have been following Shawn around ever since this big boy was transported to our place. We were afraid they&#x2019;d follow Shawn&#x2019;s truck if he drove Clyde over here. Now let&#x2019;s hope they weren&#x2019;t paying attention to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Shawn was Allison&#x2019;s husband, and together they ran the local pet rescue shelter.</p><p>I glanced down at the crate. &#x201c;I caught Mercy Animal Sanctuary in the background when the Today Show aired Clyde&#x2019;s story. I suppose they found out about him because of the piece that ran in our town paper?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who knows? It seems to me anytime a cat travels more than fifty miles, he or she makes the national news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You two come on into the living room,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Can I get you some sweet tea? Water? A soda?&#x201d; I took the bag of food and treats she&#x2019;d placed on top of the crate and led the way through the foyer.</p><p>The sweet perfume of early summer&#x2019;s pine and Carolina jasmine wafted through the air as Allison carried Clyde in his crate with some effort. Although of a slight build&#x2014;three inches shorter than my five foot four&#x2014;Allison had well-toned biceps and strong legs from her work at the sanctuary. If she was struggling with that crate, my guess was that I was about to meet a big boy&#x2014;maybe bigger than my nearly twenty-pound Maine coon, Merlot.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing to drink,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I am exhausted and want to sneak back home before one of those weird reporters accosts me with questions. And I&#x2019;m not talking about your Kara. She&#x2019;s been nothing but wonderful.&#x201d;</p><p>Kara was my stepdaughter, my late husband&#x2019;s daughter, and the editor and owner of the local newspaper, the Mercy Messenger.</p><p>Allison set the carrier down near my chenille sofa, and my three kitties immediately surrounded Clyde. Syrah is a sorrel Abyssinian, Merlot a red tabby Maine coon, and Chablis a seal point Himalayan. I heard no growling coming from inside the crate&#x2014;unusual, but a relief. Maybe Clyde would fit in here quickly.</p><p>I turned to Allison. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not upset that Kara broke the story about Mr. Jeffrey and Clyde in the Messenger?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. It&#x2019;s these out-of-towners who bother me. It all started as a simple human interest piece as far as Kara was concerned.&#x201d; Allison knelt by the carrier. &#x201c;Shawn was happy to talk to her about Clyde&#x2014;even though he&#x2019;d rather be speaking with dogs, cats or birds. Who knew the major networks would run with this? Maybe that&#x2019;s because it doesn&#x2019;t quite have a happy ending yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is sad about Mr. Jeffrey&#x2019;s death and how poor Clyde never made it home in time to be with his friend,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But Candace won&#x2019;t tell me much about what they found at the man&#x2019;s house except to say that if not for Clyde, his body would still be lying there undiscovered.&#x201d;</p><p>Deputy Candace Carson, a local police officer and my best friend, was investigating the man&#x2019;s passing. Kara reported that his death was assumed to be from natural causes, but the coroner had not released an official report. Only three days had passed, though. Maybe tomorrow we&#x2019;d know more.</p><p>Allison rested a loving hand on top of the crate. &#x201c;Norm, poor Clyde&#x2019;s best buddy, is gone, and I know this guy feels the loss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I understand why Mr. Jeffrey&#x2014;Norm&#x2014;placed Clyde away from his home,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He sent him to stay with his sister or his nephew, right? At least, those are the two people on the news I saw giving interviews.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;Clyde was supposedly with the sister, a woman named Millicent Boatman. That other person on TV was her son, Dirk. Anyway, Mr. Jeffrey took the cat down to Hilton Head where the Boatman woman lived two months ago, but Clyde ran off. Then he showed up on Norm&#x2019;s doorstep several days ago and raised a ruckus. Woke the neighbors, who wondered why in the heck Norm didn&#x2019;t hear his old friend meowing at the door.&#x201d;</p><p>I peered into the crate and said, &#x201c;But there was no waking your friend, huh, buddy?&#x201d;</p><p>Clyde, a gigantic orange tabby with the kind of upturned mouth that looks like a perpetual smile, blinked at me. This boy had traveled more than two hundred miles to get home. A combination of sorrow and admiration created a lump in my throat.</p><p>Allison said, &#x201c;Shawn is not inclined to hand this cat back over to the sister without first talking to her away from the cameras. He wants to know how Clyde escaped from her house. And would you believe she hasn&#x2019;t even shown up in Mercy yet? Too busy giving interviews to CNN, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I gather they&#x2019;re still thinking Mr. Jeffrey died of natural causes?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Far as I know. The man did have cancer.&#x201d; She whispered the last word. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know what kind&#x2014;not sure I want to know.&#x201d; Allison&#x2019;s eyes filled as she fixed a short, burnished wave of hair behind her ear.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;I guess Mr. Jeffrey must have been too frail to care for this big fella. Anyway, I promise to heap tons of love on him if he&#x2019;ll let me.&#x201d; I was feeling the need to comfort both Allison and Clyde now. &#x201c;This guy knew his owner was ill and he needed to get home.&#x201d; I watched Syrah, my bravest kitty, nose in close to the carrier door.</p><p>&#x201c;Kara kept anything she knew about Mr. Jeffrey&#x2019;s private medical issues out of the paper,&#x201d; Allison said. &#x201c;But those reporters must have got someone to talk. Like this Millicent person, maybe?&#x201d;</p><p>Chablis rubbed against Allison&#x2019;s knee, her curiosity about Clyde satisfied for now. Besides, she knew Allison needed a little comfort.</p><p>Allison sat cross-legged on the floor so Chablis could climb into her lap.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that Norm adopted Clyde from us?&#x201d; She stroked Chablis, who closed her eyes and raised her chin to offer her throat. Allison complied and stroked it.</p><p>&#x201c;I had no idea.&#x201d; I pushed two fingers through the carrier grate to let Clyde sniff my fingers. &#x201c;When was that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clyde walked right up to our sanctuary door a couple years ago,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;&#x2019;Course he was a kitten and a third the size he is now. You can imagine our surprise when Candace brought him back to us the other day. We recognized him right away by his smile.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, troubled. &#x201c;All they want to talk about on the news is Clyde&#x2019;s voyage home. I heard next to nothing about poor Mr. Jeffrey and how much he probably missed his cat during his illness.&#x201d;</p><p>Allison said, &#x201c;Thing is, it&#x2019;s not all that amazing for a cat to travel long distances to return home. Those TV folks don&#x2019;t understand the true feline nature if they think it&#x2019;s odd.&#x201d; The passion for animals that both Allison and Shawn felt came through in her voice. &#x201c;Animals love with all their hearts. There&#x2019;re a few humans I know who could take a lesson from them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for sure. But I don&#x2019;t understand why these reporters are still hanging around. I mean, the story&#x2019;s over, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no. Not over yet. One of those reporters was shouting at my husband this morning, yelling that he knew Shawn wasn&#x2019;t in any hurry to turn over the cat to Millicent Boatman.&#x201d; She shook her head in annoyance.</p><p>&#x201c;How could they possibly know?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;No. That was a silly question. The folks in Mercy do love to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;As far as Shawn is concerned, this cat will not be turned over to a woman who couldn&#x2019;t hang on to him, so I am sure there will be a bit of a disagreement over who gets possession of Clyde. Like anyone can really possess a cat.&#x201d; She grinned, and it warmed my heart to see her lovely smile.</p><p>&#x201c;You got that right,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, the story continues. Candace says&#x2014;and you know how thorough Candace is when it comes to an investigation&#x2014;anyways, she agrees that until she knows for sure who Clyde should go home with, he stays with us. Well, now with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still, Mr. Jeffrey did give Clyde to his sister, so if she persists about wanting him back, then&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. Not yet, anyway. Shawn worries that Clyde will leave Hilton Head again and might not make it back to Mercy the next time.&#x201d; Allison continued to pet Chablis, who purred loud enough to wake the birds sleeping outside.</p><p>Clyde finally broke into the conversation, and the sound made me start. His meow was louder than a small dog&#x2019;s bark. No wonder Mr. Jeffrey&#x2019;s neighbors had heard him.</p><p>Merlot backed off a couple feet from the crate, and this time, his tail puffed and he growled. Syrah&#x2019;s coat stood on end, too. But Chablis? She was content in Allison&#x2019;s lap, completely unaffected by Clyde.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow. That&#x2019;s quite a voice he&#x2019;s got,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;He can be very vocal. He had to be to get the neighbor&#x2019;s attention. Hope he doesn&#x2019;t keep you awake tonight.&#x201d; Allison gently moved Chablis off her lap and stood. &#x201c;And now, I need to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>I rose, too. &#x201c;Is Clyde on scheduled meals? I mean, he seems awfully big and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Big, yes. Overweight, no&#x2014;probably because of the long trip he just made. We&#x2019;ve been filling his bowl as soon as it&#x2019;s empty because he&#x2019;s hungry all the time,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;What about his feet after his trek? Are they okay?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Syrah had jumped on the sofa behind me so he could look down at the crate&#x2014;and be higher than our new friend, Clyde.</p><p>&#x201c;His feet are fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;All he suffered was a little dehydration. He didn&#x2019;t even need worming. My guess is this guy made friends along the way&#x2014;and he made good time, too. Took him a couple months. Probably walked five to ten miles a day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow. I&#x2019;d be exhausted&#x2014;and probably lost&#x2014;if I were him. But since cats have their own little GPS in their brains, they aren&#x2019;t quite as directionally challenged as someone like me.&#x201d; I picked up the bag of kibble. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be starting Clyde out in the basement guest bedroom. As soon as you called, I ran down there and put out a clean cat quilt, a litter box and fresh water.&#x201d;</p><p>Allison smiled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll spoil him rotten. And he deserves to be spoiled. I&#x2019;ll carry him down for you. This boy is heavy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe I&#x2019;ll let you do that. I don&#x2019;t want to drop him.&#x201d;</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, a tired Allison was on her way home and Clyde was already digging into his food while I sat by and watched.</p><p>I knew my three cats would not be joining me in bed tonight. They&#x2019;d be parked outside the guest room door until dawn. Cats do not like a closed door, especially when a visitor is on the other side.</p><p>I&#x2019;d miss them, but cats have to do what cats have to do.</p><p><b>Two</b></p><p>At first, the loud and insistent knocking on my front door seemed to be part of a dream. Was I experiencing Allison&#x2019;s late-night visit all over again? But the noise persisted and grew even louder. I sat up and squinted at the nightstand clock. Seven a.m.</p><p>Seven a.m? What the heck?</p><p>I grumbled as I got out of bed and found the jeans I&#x2019;d left on the floor last night. My friends do not knock on my front door; they come to the back of the house. And they call first&#x2014;at least most of the time. So, though I wanted to cover my head with my pillow and grab another hour of sleep, I had to find out who was being so demanding. Maybe a neighbor had lost a pet . . . or maybe Allison needed me to do something else for her. But she could have phoned. No, this was something else, and I had a bad feeling about it.</p><p>Groggy from staying up too late playing with my new friend, Clyde, I felt almost hungover as I rummaged in my dresser for a T-shirt. What a fun cat that big boy was, and once he started playing the &#x201c;paws under the door&#x201d; game with my crew without any hissing or growling involved, I decided it was okay to let my three curious felines into the room to meet him right away. It helped that mine were used to an occasional feline guest, but I still thought it best that after I supervised their getting to know one another, I&#x2019;d shut them out for the night.</p><p>Now, when I could have used another hour of sleep, I&#x2019;d been awoken by some person pounding&#x2014;yes, now they were pounding&#x2014;on my front door.</p><p>I grabbed my cell phone as I hurried to see just what was so urgent. When I peered through the peephole, I saw something I certainly didn&#x2019;t expect: a man who I could have sworn was wearing makeup&#x2014;and maybe even hair spray.</p><p>Huh? Since I couldn&#x2019;t see beyond the distortion of his large sandy-haired head through the peephole, I hurried back to my living room, grabbed the remote and turned on my television. It was a new smart TV, and my security expert and boyfriend, Tom Stewart, had set it up so I could access a screen that showed the view from every security camera installed outside my home.</p><p>Sure enough, I could see the entire picture of what was transpiring out there.</p><p>&#x201c;Darn it all,&#x201d; I muttered. But I was glad for all my cameras. Tom installed them after Syrah had been catnapped a few years ago, and I could have never anticipated how much I appreciated being able to see most of my property, both inside and out. Plus all the feeds were connected to my smartphone. Even if I was away from home, I knew what was happening here. I&#x2019;d told Tom he could probably make a fortune selling his techniques for this sort of thing, but he said other companies already did similar work and that he didn&#x2019;t really care to get involved in business that might involve travel or take up more time than his PI and security business already did.</p><p>Various other people besides this man loitered on my lawn, drinking coffee or staring vacantly at the front of my house. The man at the door had on a suit and there was a woman with swept-back blond hair who wore an expensive-looking print dress and high heels, but others wore shorts, T-shirts and headphones. And not small earbud headphones, either. Big headphones. Cables snaked along my driveway to a van with a satellite dish on top. Yes, the TV folks had found Clyde. And, of course, they&#x2019;d found me, too. I was again reminded there are no secrets in the small town of Mercy. Not for long.</p><p>I found Candace&#x2019;s number in my speed dial. Though worried I might wake her, I had no idea what to do about this situation. I might need her police presence here.</p><p>Fortunately, she seemed quite alert when she said, &#x201c;Hey there.

He also had a lifelong passion for magic tricks and puzzles. Well known for his mathematical games column in <i>Scientific American</i> and his "Trick of the Month" in <i>Physics Teacher</i> magazine, Gardner attracted a loyal following with his intelligence, wit, and imagination. <p><b>Martin Gardner: A Remembrance <br></b>The worldwide mathematical community was saddened by the death of Martin Gardner on May 22, 2010. Martin was 95 years old when he died, and had written 70 or 80 books during his long lifetime as an author. Martin's first Dover books were published in 1956 and 1957: <i>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery,</i> one of the first popular books on the intellectual excitement of mathematics to reach a wide audience, and <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,</i> certainly one of the first popular books to cast a devastatingly skeptical eye on the claims of pseudoscience and the many guises in which the modern world has given rise to it. Both of these pioneering books are still in print with Dover today along with more than a dozen other titles of Martin's books. They run the gamut from his elementary <i>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing,</i> which has been enjoyed by generations of younger readers since the 1980s, to the more demanding <i>The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings,</i> which Dover published in its final revised form in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>To those of us who have been associated with Dover for a long time, however, Martin was more than an author, albeit a remarkably popular and successful one. As a member of the small group of long-time advisors and consultants, which included NYU's Morris Kline in mathematics, Harvard's I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science, and MIT's J. P. Den Hartog in engineering, Martin's advice and editorial suggestions in the formative 1950s helped to define the Dover publishing program and give it the point of view which &#x2014; despite many changes, new directions, and the consequences of evolution &#x2014; continues to be operative today. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Politicians, real-estate agents, used-car salesmen, and advertising copy-writers are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions, but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime.

He is the author of <i>Working on the Edge,</i> <i>Nights of Ice</i>, and <i>Coming Back Alive</i>.</p>ONE<br>Slammed right and left by battering, 60 mph wind gusts, blinded by snow squalls at the leading edge of an Arctic storm, search and rescue pilot Lieutenant David Neel was doing his best, early on that cold December morning in 2004, to shake off the sudden bouts of vertigo and keep his H-60 helicopter on course and in the air. Flying along over the gray and white, foam- streaked waters of the Bering Sea, Neel maintained an altitude of just three hundred feet, and no more, to prevent icing as the tall, clutching storm waves lumbered past below. He and his crew had been ordered to Dutch Harbor, where they would refuel and prepare to launch out on an emerging crisis: The Selen dang Ayu, a giant of a freighter, a 738-foot-lonag cargo ship bound for China with over 60,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest soybeans, had apparently lost her engine while following the Great Circle route across those same, intractable waters 170 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor. With some 455,000 gallons of bulk oil stored in her tanks, and twenty- six sailors trapped aboard her, the freighter was now drifting on a collision course with the hull-crushing shores of the Aleutian Islands.<br>If no one was able to alter her freewheeling advance, and efforts either to restart her engine or pass a towline to her failed, the freighter would soon be driven onto the rocks of Unalaska Island inside the largest maritime seabird nesting area in all of North America. Should an oil spill ensue&#x2014;a distinct possibility, given the furious, wind- driven seas now propelling the ship along&#x2014;the impact on those vulnerable creatures could be disastrous, the damage to the environment largely irreparable.<br>The Panamax-class vessel, the largest of the bulk freighters whose hull could still fit through the Panama Canal, was said to be drifting beam-to the pummeling waves. Some of the prodigious breakers slamming into her and driving her toward shore were reportedly as large as freight train boxcars. At times, the wayward vessel was rolling so wildly from side to side, that the six hundred or so feet of her massive deck was tilting almost vertically.<br>The weather reports, too, were equally alarming. A storm packing blizzard snows with peak wind gusts approaching hurricane force was currently drafting down out of Rus sia's Siberian Arctic. Accelerating as it came, the cold front had marched down over the polar ice pack, and was now racing unhindered across the vast, open reaches of the Bering Sea.<br>Dave Neel was certain, however, that well before the peak of the storm reached them, he and his crew would be sent to the scene with orders to hoist as many of the sailors as possible off the Selendang Ayu's deck before she sank, ran aground, or rolled over. But he also knew that plucking survivors off the heaving deck of a freighter careening through high seas wouldn't be easy; and that doing so in as little time as possible would be absolutely imperative.<br>Born and raised in Vian, Oklahoma&#x2014;a town of just 1,200 people, surrounded by farmland&#x2014;Dave Neel grew up hunting and fishing, was a fifth-generation Oklahoman, and the son of a bricklayer. His people worked in the construction trade. Dirt moving. Concrete pouring Home building. His parents raised him and his brothers in a traditional, God-fearing, Baptist belief system, one centered around hard work, honest living, and fair play.<br>Neel knew the H-60 Jayhawk helicopter well. He'd flown them for years in the army, and also on a tour for the Coast Guard (CG) out of Clearwater, Florida. But the base outside Kodiak was this aviator's ultimate destination, a place reserved for the Coast Guard's most trusted and experienced pilots. Only second-tour aviators or better were sent there. In fact, famed Alaskan chopper pilot Russ Zullick was one of Dave Neel's best friends.<br>Just twelve hours before, Neel and his crew had been sitting in the cargo hold of a C-130, crossing the Shumagin Islands, when Commander (Cdr.) Bill Deal called him forward into the aircraft's cockpit and told him of the crisis building in the Bering Sea. Their C-130 was being diverted to Cold Bay. An H-60 would be waiting. Neel and his crew needed to start planning the rescue.<br>Recognizing a true crisis in the making, Coast Guard officials had also ordered the cutter Alex Haley, to the scene. In addition, they'd dispatched several tugboats, including the oceangoing tug Sidney Foss and the harbor tug James Dunlap to try to intercept the drifting giant before it ran aground, scattering fuel, cargo, and bodies along the wild, inhospitable shores of Unalaska Island.<br>Cdr. Matt Bell, the captain on the Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley, was about 150 miles away, monitoring the actions of a fleet of codfish longliners, when he received word of the errant freighter's path and location. Bell and his crew were just winding down from fifty or so days of patroling the westernmost reaches of the Bering Sea along the U.S./Russia border, and were about to stand down and steam back to Kodiak for a well-deserved bit of R &amp; R. But now Bell was ordered to locate the vessel, and to assess the situation.<br>Riding a quartering sea, and moving in the direction of the freighter with all possible urgency, Cdr. Bell set out in hot pursuit of the freighter. However, because the seas were rough, the Alex Haley could only move at ten knots (11 mph), and it would be a number of hours before they would catch up with the Selendang Ayu. But with half a dozen engineers reportedly among the vessel's crew, Cdr. Bell thought the Ayu's crew might get their engine back up and running before he even caught sight of her.<br>Standing six feet tall, and weighing a lean 170 pounds, Cdr. Bell was well suited for the duty at hand. Raised in Georgia by family-oriented parents, he was taught the fundamentals of discipline, work, and academic achievement, a lifestyle that was also accompanied by robust outdoor living.<br>As a small boy, his first exposure to the sea was while camping and fishing for Spanish mackerel at the water's edge of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. During those impressionable years, the Coast Guard bug bit him hard, for he often observed the gleaming white patrol boats cruising the inlets and passageways that wind their way through the beautiful archipelago of islands that make up that seaboard region.<br>&#x201c;Our summer house was on the inland waterways there,&#x201d; he recalls. &#x201c;You had to take the pass down through all the back bays to get to the jetty before you could get out to the ocean.&#x201d;<br>Bell's father, a Marine formerly stationed on Okinawa, was a &#x201c;hunter-camper-fisher,&#x201d; says Bell. &#x201c;I think he was handed a fishing pole to hold before he could even walk.&#x201d; Along with four brothers and one sister, Matt Bell took naturally to the outdoors. Never bothered by seasickness, he loved fishing with his father, and joined him every chance he got.<br>&#x201c;I don't know if I could even name a more patriotic guy than my father,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Pledge of Allegiance. Love of God and country. My dad believed that serving one's country was both a duty and an honor.&#x201d;<br>In 1985, Matt Bell joined the Coast Guard. In a very real sense, it seems Cdr. Bell had been headed into the military from the get-go. Surviving boot camp, he was quickly scooped up and sent to Officer Candidate School (OCS). Steady promotions followed solid tours of duty out of the port cities of New Orleans and San Francisco. One of Cdr. Bell's first SAR (search and rescue) cases was picking up debris off the Florida coast after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, and its entire crew was killed.<br>In 1987, Cdr. Bell and his family were assigned to the base in Kodiak, Alaska. At that time he began serving on board Coast Guard cutter patrols in the Bering Sea.<br>Now, some seventeen years later, and a veteran at navigating those untamed waters, Cdr. Bell pointed the Alex Haley in the direction of the disabled freighter, and gave chase.<br>Eventually, as the Alex Haley began to close in on the drifting hulk, Cdr. Bell's officer of the deck (OD) was able to make radio contact with the skipper of the Selen dang Ayu. It was still dark out when they finally caught up with her. Cdr. Bell and his executive officer (X/O), Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Phil Thorne, stepped out on the flying bridge for a better look.<br>&#x201c;Wow! She's a big one!&#x201d; said Bell, peering at the long, well-lighted wheelhouse and wave-thrashed deck through his powerful field glasses. &#x201c;We're sure going to need those tugs.&#x201d;<br>Inside the C-130 being diverted to Cold Bay, Dave Neel returned to the cargo area, grabbed his maps, and gave fellow co-pilot Lt. Doug Watson the &#x201c;quick skinny&#x201d; on the situation. Next, he presented the news to flight mechanic Petty Officer 2nd Class Brian Lickfield, and rescue swimmer Petty Officer 3rd Class Aaron Bean. Then, he sat and did some brainstorming: &#x201c;How much gas would it take to reach the scene? How long will I be able to remain there?<br>How many people can I carry in the H-60 in a single load?&#x201d;<br>Initially, Neel calculated that he could carry nine of the stranded sailors per load. Flying the H-60 helicopter directly to the scene&#x2014;its call sign CG6020&#x2014;they'd gather them up and take them immediately to Dutch Harbor, top off the fuel tanks again, and rush back for more of the Selendang Ayu's crew. He and his flight crew would make the turnaround in Dutch Harbor in record time.<br>Meanwhile, Cdr. Doug Cameron, the officer in charge of CG6021, the other H-60 Jayhawk, would hoist the second load of nine off the freighter. That would be eighteen saved, leaving just eight, including the ship's captain, to go. Neel and Watson would race back then, hover in close and, if all went well, load up the last of the survivors in as little as fifteen minutes, and they'd be out of there.<br>But if things should go sideways on them, there were certain realities to consider. For one, the edge of the polar ice pack was now floating just north of the Pribilof Islands, which meant that the waters of the Bering Sea, at that time of the year, would be only a couple of degrees above freezing. In addition, their mission would draw them out over those wind-ravaged waters at about the same time the heart of the storm reached them.<br>The moment their C-130 touched down in Cold Bay, Dave Neel called Kodiak and spoke with Cdr. Bob Phillips, his ops officer. He wanted to get a better picture of what, exactly, was happening. Phillips told him to stand down on launching the H-60 and await further instructions.<br>&#x201c;Hold tight there in Cold Bay,&#x201d; said Phillips. &#x201c;We're sending another H-60 down. It'll be there later tonight. So far, it looks like you guys might not have to go out, because the oceangoing tugboat Sidney Foss is responding. So just stand fast for now.&#x201d;<br>It was well after dark when the second H-60 arrived from its base on Kodiak Island. Pilots Guy &#x201c;Yogi&#x201d; Pierce and Larry Quedado (since deceased) had flown over with it. But with no room left inside the hangar, they were forced to park it outside on the snow-covered runway.<br>Born and raised in Cranford, New Jersey, fellow pilot Doug Watson was five foot ten, weighed 180 pounds, had sandy blond hair, and was widely recognized as a superb helicopter pilot. He had earned a bachelor's degree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Trained, initially, to be a professional or corporate pilot, Watson was also a certified flight instructor.<br>Signing on with the Coast Guard was an unusual move for someone with his background. He'd attended Officer Candidate School for eighteen months in Pensacola, Florida, then spent another six weeks in Mobile, Alabama, learning to fly the legendary H-60 Jayhawk helicopter. For the next four years he flew missions out of Air Station Clearwater on the Florida coast, before joining the exceptional band of flyboys at Air Station Kodiak.<br>As a seasoned pilot, now several years into his Alaskan tour, Doug Watson had, of course, been in some very tight spots of his own. Should they need him to fly on such an icy, windswept night, he felt fully up to the challenge.<br>While outside an arctic wind raked the frozen ground, inside Bill and Mary Cochran's hospitable Cold Bay Lodge, Dave Neel, Doug Watson, Aaron Bean, and Brian Lickfield&#x2014;and their Coast Guard brothers&#x2014;sat themselves down to a hearty Alaskan meal of steak and king crab, with all the trimmings.<br>After dinner, Dave Neel and Doug Watson had withdrawn to their respective rooms and were fast asleep when word of the developing drama reached them. It was flight mechanic Joe Metzler who delivered the news: They were to launch their H-60 as soon as possible.<br>Outside, it was pitch dark. Numbing winds driving a blizzard snow were howling across the runway and throughout the Aleutian Islands, creating an aviator's nightmare over much of the Bering Sea. The tugboat Sidney Foss's efforts to take the huge ship in tow had ultimately failed. Metzler informed them that they were to preposition them<br>Excerpted from On The Edge of Survival by Spike Walker.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Spike Walker.<br>Published in 2010 by St. Martin's Press<br>All rights reserved.

A heartbreaking vision of a vanishing world, it established Kantner as one of the nation&#x2019;s most original and authentic writers. Here, he returns to the setting of his debut novel with an autobiographical account of his own life in a rapidly changing land. Beginning with his parents&#x2019; migration to the Alaskan wilderness in the 1950s and extending to his own attempts to balance hunting with writing, Kantner recalls cold nights wrapped in caribou hides, fur-clad visitors arriving on dog sleds, swimming amidst ice floes for wounded waterfowl, and his longstanding respect for the old I�upiaq ways. Captured in words and images, these details combine to reveal a singular landscape at a pivotal moment in its history. Both an elegy and a romp, the book illuminates a world few will see as Kantner has.</p><p><br> Suspense and heartache are matched by wry humor and outrage, and all is infused with Kantner&#x2019;s humility and deep respect for the wild as he decries the practices of high-tech trophy hunters, and maps his own metamorphosis from trapper and hunter to writer and photographer. Crafted with the precision and nerve acquired by living off the land, this is a powerful and important book of remembrance, protest, and warning.&#x201d;<br> <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> Inspiring stories of an upbringing in the frosty wilderness. Employing a pleasant, conversational tone, novelist and outdoor photographer Kantner fondly relates his life in Alaska.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus</i><br><br> A lovely memoir. [Kantner} documents the wisdom of the disappearing Inuit culture his dad revered, and locates its place in modern life. With a sensitive, graceful voice and his own stunning color images, Kantner proves an appealing and talented artist.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> In his new memoir, Kantner describes an Alaskan childhood spent trapping wolverines and jigging for grayling with his back-to-the-land parents and, later, on his own.&#x201d;<br> <i>Outside</i><br><br> Whatever mental picture you have of life in rural Alaska, these autobiographical essays will make you see something different. Kantner&#x2019;s pull-no-punches, head-on stories are raw, beautiful, and unnerving.&#x201d;<br> <i>Orion</i><br><br> The stories are spell-binding, the writing magnificent.&#x201d;<br> <i>Missoulian</i><br><br> The definition of life in the Bush has changed radically in the days since he was born and while tradition demands one thing, modern living tends to veer in another direction. Kantner is as conflicted as anyone else on this subject but he bravely asks the questions and voices the concerns that usually go unheard. When you couple this with his observations about the changing climate in his backyard,&#x201d; the book becomes a powerful exploration of our rapidly evolving world and a primer for understanding the dichotomy between the two strongest versions of Alaskan life.&#x201d;<br> <i>Bookslut.com</i><br><br> <i>Shopping for Porcupine</i> is a book that weaves between worry and worship, to borrow a phrase from its author, Seth Kantner. The autobiographical essays collected here offer a glimpse of Kantner&#x2019;s life in his native north Alaska, portraying a harsh landscape at once torn by progress and brimming with wild blessings.&#x201d;<br> <i>High Country News</i><br><br> Kantner is a natural (no pun intended) storyteller, and describes the tundra&#x2019;s immensity and timelessness so completely that you imagine you could look out across it and see mammoth.&#x201d;<br> <i>Bloomsbury Review</i><br><br> One of the most beautiful books you&#x2019;ll ever read truthful, raw, and lovely. The photographs make the sparse Arctic Alaskan landscape monumentally visible and profound, while Kantner&#x2019;s writing imparts heroic dignity to the lives around him. This book is bound to become a classic alongside the works of Loren Eiseley, Edward Abbey, and John McPhee.&#x201d;<br> Jonis Agee, author of <i>The River Wife</i> and <i>Strange Angels</i><br><br> Full of stunning images, and only some of them are in the photos.

It&#x2019;s all quite unforgettable.&#x201d;<br> Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy</i> and <i>The End of Nature</i><br><br> Seth Kantner illuminates an Alaska most of us will never know.&#x201d;<br> Andrea Barrett, author of <i>Ship Fever</i> and <i>The Voyage of the Narwhal</i><br><br> For all the popularity of the recent bestseller and hit movies about Alaska, <i>Shopping for Porcupine</i> comes from a place you haven&#x2019;t seen and can hardly imagine.<br> Dan O&#x2019;Neill, author of <i>A Land Gone Lonesome</i><br><br> Searing honesty, lyric style, and raw emotional power. In <i>Ordinary Wolves</i>, you glimpsed Seth Kantner&#x2019;s life between the words. Here you meet it head-on.&#x201d;<br> Nick Jans, author of <i>The Last Light Breaking</i><br>*Starred Review* Kantner&#x2019;s gripping first book, the novel Ordinary Wolves (2004), embodied a unique perspective on Alaskan life. Now the Whiting Award&#x2013;winning&nbsp;author shares true stories of his own tundra experiences in a book of bracing essays and beautiful photographs. The son of intrepid, back-to-the-land free spirits from Ohio, Kantner, born in an igloo in 1965, dreamed of becoming a great hunter in the Eskimo tradition, but most&nbsp;Inupiaq&nbsp;eagerly embraced mainstream American culture and technology. Indeed, paradox and loss abound in Kantner&#x2019;s riveting and provocative tales of hunting caribou and moose, and in his poignant profiles of elders with vast knowledge of the tundra who are being displaced by&nbsp;the results of climate change, from rising seas to melting permafrost and treacherously thin ice. Suspense and heartache are matched by wry humor and outrage, and all is infused with Kantner&#x2019;s humility and deep respect for the wild as he decries the practices of&nbsp;high-tech trophy hunters, and maps his&nbsp;own metamorphosis from trapper and hunter to writer and photographer. Crafted with the precision and nerve acquired by living&nbsp;off the land,&nbsp;this is a powerful and important book of remembrance, protest, and warning. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>75 Hikes in California's Mount Shasta &amp; Lassen Volcanic National Park Regions (100 Hikes in Series)</h2><p><br><br>* Guidebook features day hikes and extended backpacking trails<br><br>* Includes recommendations on gear, safety, and hiking etiquette<br><br>* Also includes information on Mt.

Today, many are questioning this elevation of reason over faith. How should Christians respond to a secular world that continues to push faith to the margins? <br><br>While there is still no consensus concerning what a postmodern society should look like, James K. A. Smith suggests that the answer is a reaffirmation of the belief that Jesus is Lord over all. Smith traces the trends and directions of Radical Orthodoxy, proposing that it can provide an old-but-new theology for a new generation of Christians. This book will challenge and encourage pastors and thoughtful laypeople interested in learning more about currents in contemporary theology.</p><p>James K. A. Smith (Ph.D., Villanova University) is the Gary &amp; Henrietta Byker Chair in Applied Reformed Theology &amp; Worldview at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In addition, he is editor of <i>Comment </i>magazine and a senior fellow of the Colossian Forum. He formerly taught at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Active in both the church and the academy, Smith is the author of <i>Speech and Theology</i> (part of the Routledge Radical Orthodoxy series) and <i>The Fall of Interpretation</i>.&#34;Smith is always fair and kind to his Radical Orthodoxy interlocutors, yet he is able to distance himself when necessary. Persons wanting to familiarize themselves with the movement will need to read Smith&#39;s book to get a clear picture of what drives Radical Orthodoxy theologians and to contextualize their own readings of Radical Orthodoxy authors. I was particularly impressed by Smith&#39;s ability to lay out the key elements of Radical Orthodoxy&#39;s approach. He writes clearly and understandably, without unnecessarily simplifying the issues involved. This book will no doubt be read with interest, as well as with profit, by theologians, philosophers, students, and other keen individuals.&#34;</p><h2>The Outcast: Prequel to the Summoner Trilogy (The Summoner Trilogy, 4)</h2><p><p>The thrilling prequel to the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling Summoner series!</p><p>When stable boy Arcturus accidentally summons a demon and becomes Hominum's first common summoner, he becomes the key to a secret that the powerful overlords would do anything to keep hidden. </p><p>Whisked away to Vocans Academy so he can be kept watch over, Arcturus finds himself surrounded by enemies.

He died in 2007.<p>&#x201c;Christopher Gilbert's poems seem to emerge from the desire to know and be known. They create a sense of deep intimacy from a pulsing soul somewhere out there opening the floodgates of heart, mind, and spirit. The poems hold so much. But their everything-ness, while exhilarating, also reminds us that there is never enough time for all the knowing and feeling that now seem so near. He sounds like no other; his poems were generative for many poets, myself included.

Lee aims to address the dilemmas of contextual theology not by moving one or another group from the margin to the center, but by redefining marginality itself as central. Marginality, he contends, is not only the experience of being outside the dominant group or in-between groups, but also &#34;in-beyond&#34;-a holistic, process-oriented definition that highlights the catalytic, transformative potential of living at the creative nexus of worlds. Lee&#39;s insight into marginality leads him directly into a new model for contextual theologies that focuses not on historical experience but on creative potential. His chapters work out concretely what such a notion can mean culturally, methodologically, and doctrinally to a movement that professes to follow the very paradigm of creative marginality, Jesus Christ.</p><p></p><h2>Death in the Garden</h2><p>In 1925 beautiful, bohemian Diana Pollexfen was celebrating her 30th birthday with a party at a country estate, but the celebrations soured when her husband died, poisoned by a cocktail that had been liberally laced with some of Diana&#39;s photographic chemicals.

They figured becoming acolytes was the best way to ease into the whole universe-saving thing. The two friends sat together on a musty old couch in a small New York City apartment. They were there to learn the mysterious ways of the acolytes. Not exactly dramatic surroundings, considering they were hearing words that would change their lives forever.<br><br>"You are the acolytes from Second Earth now," said Tom Dorney, whose apartment it was. "With Press gone, I'm no longer needed. It may be an easy job compared to what the Travelers do, but I think you'll agree it's an important one."<br><br>"We do. Absolutely. Yessir," Mark and Courtney assured him.<br><br>Dorney turned to look out his window and frowned. He was an old guy with short-cropped gray hair and excellent posture. He was once a soldier. Old habits die hard.<br><br>"Is there something you're not telling us?" Courtney asked.<br><br>Dorney sighed and said, "It's just a feeling."<br><br>"What?" she demanded.<br><br>"I don't know," Dorney said, troubled. "I didn't like what I heard about Veelox."<br><br>"Yeah, no kidding," Courtney said.<br><br>"What I mean to say is, be careful. Saint Dane has finally had a victory, and there's no telling what's next. From this point on, I can't guarantee that the old rules still apply."<br><br>This was chilling news for Mark and Courtney on their first official day as acolytes. Dorney's ominous warning was very much on their minds as they left his apartment and took the train back to Stony Brook, Connecticut. Just before the train pulled into Stony Brook Station, Mark announced, "I want to go to the flume."<br><br>"Why?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"We'll bring some of our clothes to leave there."<br><br>"But nobody told us they needed clothes," Courtney countered.<br><br>"I know. Just thinking ahead."<br><br>"That's just an excuse to go there, isn't it?" Courtney asked.<br><br>Mark didn't argue. "I guess I just want to see it again. To prove it's real."<br><br>"I hear you," Courtney said. "I do too."<br><br>When they got off the train, they both went home and gathered up a bunch of clothes they thought a Traveler from some distant territory might need on a visit to Second Earth. That's what acolytes did. They supported the Travelers on their mission to protect Halla. Courtney picked out a bunch of simple, functional things like jeans, T-shirts, a sweater, socks, hiking boots, and underwear. She debated about bringing one of her bras, but figured that was overkill. Mark gathered up a bunch of clothes that were totally out of style. It wasn't like he had a choice. That's all he had. He found sweatshirts with logos that meant nothing, no-name jeans, and generic sneakers. Style was not something Mark concerned himself with. He hoped the Travelers felt the same way.<br><br>Mark brought one extra item, but hoped he wouldn't need it. It was the sharp poker from his parents' fireplace. It was a woefully inadequate weapon to deal with an attacking quig-dog, but it was all he could find.<br><br>Shortly after, Mark and Courtney met at the iron gates in front of the empty Sherwood house. They silently walked around to the side and climbed the tree to get over the high stone wall that surrounded the spooky, abandoned estate. Once over, Mark held the fireplace poker out in front of him, ready to ward off a rampaging quig. Mark's hand was shaking like warm Jell-O, so Courtney gently took the weapon from him. If either of them had a chance of fighting off a charging quig, it would be Courtney.<br><br>Luckily they didn't run into any of the yellow-eyed beasts. They made it through the big empty mansion, down into the basement, and into the root cellar that held the newly created flume. No problem. They emptied their backpacks and neatly folded the clothes in a pile. Courtney looked at some of the geek clothes Mark brought, and chuckled.<br><br>"Oh yeah, Bobby's gonna blend right in wearing a bright yellow sweatshirt with a red logo that says, <i>'Cool Dude!'"</i><br><br>"Give me a break," Mark said defensively. "It's my favorite sweatshirt."<br><br>Courtney shook her head in disbelief. When they were finished, they both gazed into the dark tunnel to the territories. The flume. They stood together, each with his/her own thoughts as to what the future might hold.<br><br>"I'm scared and excited at the same time," Mark said.<br><br>"Really," Courtney added. "I want to be part of this, but it's scary not knowing what to expect."<br><br>"Can you imagine being a Traveler?" Mark asked while stepping into the mouth of the tunnel.<br><br>"Well, no," Courtney answered, "to be honest."<br><br>"Well, I've thought about it a lot!" Mark declared. "It would be awesome, stepping into a flume and announcing the next amazing place you'd like to go."<br><br>"It's pretty unbelievable," Courtney agreed.<br><br>"Look at this thing!" Mark said, scanning the flume. "It's kinda like having a jet fighter."<br><br>"It is?" Courtney asked with a chuckle.<br><br>"Yeah. You know what it's capable of, but have no idea what to do to make it go."<br><br>"It's not all that hard," Courtney said. "If you're a Traveler."<br><br>Mark smiled, turned to face the dark tunnel, and shouted out, <i>"Eelong!"</i><br><br>He looked back to Courtney and said, "Could you imagine if -- "<br><br>"Mark!" Courtney shouted.<br><br>Mark saw the terrified look on Courtney's face. She was looking past him, deeper into the flume. Mark spun quickly and saw something he thought was impossible.<br><br>The flume was coming to life.<br><br>Mark jumped out of the tunnel and ran to Courtney. The two backed away toward the far wall of the root cellar, hugging each other in fear.<br><br>"D-Did I do that?" Mark asked.<br><br>"Or is somebody coming?" Courtney added.<br><br>The light appeared from the depths of the tunnel. The musical notes were faint at first but quickly grew louder. The rocky walls began to crackle and groan. They had seen all this before, but only when the flume was activated by a Traveler. Never, ever had a flume been activated by a non-Traveler -- until now.<br><br>"I-I don't really want to go to Eelong," Mark cried. Courtney held him tighter, ready to hold him back if he got pulled in by the power of the flume.<br><br>The gray walls of the tunnel melted into glorious crystal as the bright light and sound arrived at the mouth. Mark and Courtney didn't dare put their hands in front of their eyes because they were too busy hanging on to each other. But neither felt the tug of the flume, because someone was headed their way. Through the bright light they saw a tall, dark silhouette appear and step out of the tunnel. Oddly, the sparkling light didn't go away. The jangle of music stayed too. This had never happened before, at least not that Mark or Courtney knew. But none of that mattered as much as the man who now stood facing them.<br><br>It was Saint Dane. He had arrived on Second Earth. The two had never seen him before, but there was no mistaking the tall demon with the long gray hair, piercing blue eyes, and dark clothes.<br><br>"And so it begins," Saint Dane cackled. "The walls are beginning to crack. The power that once was, will no longer be. It is a whole new game, with new rules."<br><br>Saint Dane roared out a laugh. With a sudden burst of light from deep inside the flume, his hair caught fire! His long gray mane exploded in flames, burning right down to his skull. Mark and Courtney watched in horror as the flames reflected in his demonic eyes. Saint Dane laughed the whole while, as if enjoying it.<br><br>Mark and Courtney didn't move, except to tremble.<br><br>The fire burned away all of Saint Dane's hair, leaving him completely bald, with angry red streaks that looked like inflamed veins running from the back of his head to his forehead. His eyes had changed too. The steely blue color had gone nearly white. He fixed those intense eyes on the two new acolytes and smiled. He tossed a dirty, cloth bag at their feet.<br><br>"A present for Pendragon," Saint Dane hissed. "Be sure he gets it, won't you?" Saint Dane took a step back into the light of the flume. "What was meant to be, is no longer," he announced. With that, he began to transform. His body turned liquid as he leaned over to put his hands on the ground. At the same time his body mutated into that of a huge, jungle cat. It was the size of a lion. His coat was brown, but speckled with black spots. The big cat snarled at Mark and Courtney, and leaped into the flume. An instant later the light swept him up and disappeared into the depths. The music faded, the crystal walls returned to stone, and the light shrank to a pin spot.<br><br>But it didn't disappear entirely.<br><br>Before Mark and Courtney could get their heads back together, the light began to grow again. The music became louder and the gray rock walls transformed back into crystal.<br><br>"My brain is exploding," Mark uttered.<br><br>A second later the bright light flashed at the mouth of the tunnel to deposit another passenger before returning to its normal, dormant state.<br><br>"Bobby!" Mark and Courtney shouted. They ran to him and threw their arms around him in fear and relief.<br><br>"What happened?" Bobby demanded, all business.<br><br>Mark and Courtney were both supercharged with adrenaline. "It was Saint Dane!" Courtney shouted. "His hair burned! It was horrible!"<br><br>"He said the rules have ch-changed, Bobby," Mark stuttered. "What did he m-mean?"<br><br>Bobby took a step back from them. Mark and Courtney sensed his tension.<br><br>"What did you do?" Bobby demanded. It sounded like he was scolding them.<br><br>"Do?" Courtney said. "We didn't do anything!"<br><br>Mark and Courtney focused on Bobby. He was wearing rags. His feet were bare, his hair was a mess, and he had a coating of dirt all over his body. He didn't smell so hot either.<br><br>"What happened to you?" Mark asked.<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Bobby shot back. He was just as charged up as they were. "Did you activate the flume?"<br><br>Mark and Courtney looked to each other. Mark said, "Uh, I g-guess so. I said 'Eelong' -- "<br><br>"No!" Bobby said in anguish.<br><br>"What's the matter?" Courtney asked. "We're not Travelers. We can't control the flume."<br><br>"Things have changed," Bobby shouted. "Saint Dane's power is growing. He's got his first territory. It's all about changing the nature of things."<br><br>"So...that means we can use the flumes?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"Don't!" Bobby demanded. "It'll just make things worse."<br><br>Mark remembered something. He ran back to the door of the root cellar and picked up the bag Saint Dane had thrown at them. "He said this was for you," Mark said, handing the bag to Bobby.<br><br>Bobby took it like it was the last thing in the world he wanted. He turned the rotten bag upside down, and something fell onto the floor. Courtney screamed. Mark took a step back in shock. Bobby stood firm, staring at the floor, his jaw muscles clenching. Lying at his feet was a human hand. It was large and dark skinned. As gruesome as this was, there was something else about it that made it nearly unbearable to look at. On one finger, was a Traveler ring.<br><br>"Gunny," Bobby whispered. It was the severed hand of the Traveler from First Earth, Vincent "Gunny" VanDyke. Bobby took a brave breath, picked up the hand, and jammed it into the bag.<br><br>"Bobby, what's happening?" Courtney asked.<br><br>"You'll know when I send my journal," he said. He turned back and ran into the mouth of the flume, clutching the bag with Gunny's hand in it. <i>"Eelong!"</i> he called out. The flume sprang back to life.<br><br>"Is Gunny all right?" Mark asked, nearly in tears.<br><br>"He's alive," Bobby said. "But I don't know for how long."<br><br>"Tell us what to do!" Courtney pleaded.<br><br>"Nothing," Bobby answered. "Wait for my journal. And whatever you do, do <i>not</i> activate the flume. That's exactly what Saint Dane wants.

His revelation of a vital, living mystical practice, based in ancient Christian thought, is a major step in linking the most esoteric traditions of the East to the largely hidden esoteric traditions of the West.</p><p><b>Kyriacos C. Markides&nbsp;</b>has written several books about Christian mysticism, including&nbsp;<i>The Magus of Strovolos</i>,&nbsp;<i>Riding with the Lion</i>,<i>&nbsp;Homage to the Sun</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fire in the Heart</i>. A professor of sociology at the University of Maine, he lives in Stillwater, Maine, with his wife, Emily.Despite his promising subtitle, Markides (sociology, Univ. of Maine) will disappoint readers interested in classical Christian mysticism. Anecdotal evidence for paranormal phenomena such as teleportation, clairvoyance, levitation, dematerialization, and channeling, along with a disorganized collage of references to Marx, Nietzsche, Plato, Huston Smith, P.D. Ouspensky, etc., are presented in the first part of the book. Markides does not succeed in his attempt to place New Age religion and paranormal psychology within the context of classical mysticism. Where he does succeed is in the account of his visit to the monasteries of Mount Athos on the coast of Greece and his encounter there with monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Libraries with collections in New Age materials and parapsychology will want to consider this book, but collections in Christian mysticism would be better served by such recent publications as Evelyn Underhill's classic Mysticism (Oxford Univ. Pr., 1993. reprint).<br><i>Linda V.

Also covered is a series of telepathic communications the author had developed with what was claimed to be an extraterrestrial intelligence. He abandoned this line of research in future work because much of the information received could not be fully verified, and he felt that delving into it more deeply could affect his other work on important scientific levels. Therefore, this book is entirely unique &#x2013; mapping out a serious scientific pursuit of hidden beings and objects in our atmosphere with the experience of strange, telepathic communications. This book also references the work of the main UFO researchers of the time including Major Donald Keyhoe, George Adamski, Harold Wilkins and George Van Tassel. Includes 36 original photos by Constable, accompanied by a chapter devoted entirely to their study.</p><p>I have read first Constables book &#34;Cosmic Pulse of Life&#34; where he tells already about his photoshooting invisible critters in the Mojave Desert, so I expected not much else of his first book &#34;They Live in the Sky,&#34; but was really surprised about the fast developing events and his encounters with an invisible etheric entity who communicated with Constable in a question-answer style which - if true (and I do believe that Constable as a man of honour merely recounts what really happened!) it is an eye-opening book and gives a lot to think about. I could not lay down the book for too long and even if one does not trust the veracity of Ashtar&#39;s statements, it is a book which one will not forget, and it reads like a thriller. --Amazon.com customer review</p><h2>When We Rise: My Life in the Movement</h2><p><b>2017 LAMBDA LITERARY AWARD WINNER <br><br>The partial inspiration for the ABC television mini-series! </b><br><br><strong>"You could read Cleve Jones's book because you should know about the struggle for gay, lesbian, and transgender rights from one of its key participants--maybe heroes--but really, you should read it for pleasure and joy."--Rebecca Solnit, author of <em>Men Explain Things to Me</em></strong><br><br>Born in 1954, Cleve Jones was among the last generation of gay Americans who grew up wondering if there were others out there like himself. There were. Like thousands of other young people, Jones, nearly penniless, was drawn in the early 1970s to San Francisco, a city electrified by progressive politics and sexual freedom. <br><br>Jones found community--in the hotel rooms and ramshackle apartments shared by other young adventurers, in the city's bathhouses and gay bars like The Stud, and in the burgeoning gay district, the Castro, where a New York transplant named Harvey Milk set up a camera shop, began shouting through his bullhorn, and soon became the nation's most outspoken gay elected official. With Milk's encouragement, Jones dove into politics and found his calling in "the movement." When Milk was killed by an assassin's bullet in 1978, Jones took up his mentor's progressive mantle--only to see the arrival of AIDS transform his life once again. <br><br>By turns tender and uproarious, <em>When We Rise</em> is Jones' account of his remarkable life. He chronicles the heartbreak of losing countless friends to AIDS, which very nearly killed him, too; his co-founding of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation during the terrifying early years of the epidemic; his conception of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest community art project in history; the bewitching story of 1970s San Francisco and the magnetic spell it cast for thousands of young gay people and other misfits; and the harrowing, sexy, and sometimes hilarious stories of Cleve's passionate relationships with friends and lovers during an era defined by both unprecedented freedom and and violence alike. <br><br><i>When We Rise</i> is not only the story of a hero to the LQBTQ community, but the vibrantly voice memoir of a full and transformative American life.</p><p><b>Cleve Jones' </b>career as an activist began in San Francisco in 1970s where he befriended pioneer gay rights leader Harvey Milk. After Milk's death, Jones co-founded the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and conceived the idea of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which memorializes over 85,000 Americans who have died from AIDS. He lives in San Francisco and works as a labor activist."Enlightening.... Unsparing.... Powerful."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"You could read Cleve Jones's book because you should know about the struggle for gay, lesbian, and transgender rights from one of its key participants-maybe heroes--but really, you should read it for pleasure and joy. It's an incredibly vivid evocation of a bygone era and a poignant story of someone who started out feeling like the only gay person in the world and ended up organizing millions of them. I loved it for the firsthand history, and the crazily great details about drag queens, radical excess, passionate idealism, how to change the world and everything else that matters most."&#x2015;<b><i>Rebecca Solnit, author of <i>Men Explain Things to Me</i></i></b><br><br>"I loved this amazing, inspiring, and sometimes outrageous book. <i>When We Rise</i> is about the building of a movement--and the building of Cleve Jones, who came to San Francisco as a teenage adventurer and transformed into an activist whose contributions helped change the course of gay history."&#x2015;<b><i>Gus Van Sant</i></b><br><br>"Cleve Jones is a history buff who has himself become part of history. He has been at the epicenter of the LGBT movement for over 45 years. Now, in <i>When We Rise</i>, Cleve takes us along on his personal journey in the fight for equal rights--a journey filled with humor, sadness, love and ultimately profound change."&#x2015;<b><i>Rob Reiner</i></b><br><br>"Some people witness history; other actually make it happen. Cleve Jones, by planting himself boldly in the eye of the storm, has succeeded brilliantly at doing both."&#x2015;<b><i>Armistead Maupin, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the <i>Tales of the City</i> series</i></b><br><br>"<i>When We Rise</i> is a song to what's best in us, when we join together in a movement that takes us higher. The story Cleve Jones tells-of a bullied boy from the sun-blasted Arizona suburbs, who finds an extended family among the street kids of San Francisco and then within the gay movement that revolutionized the world-is thrilling to read. The path to freedom is littered with the names of fallen loved ones. But through all the sorrows and setbacks, Jones persevered-and the movement for human liberation that he helped lead still rises."&#x2015;<b><i>David Talbot, bestselling author of <i>The Season of the Witch</i> and <i>The Devil's Chessboard</i></i></b><br><br>"An ode San Francisco.... an inspiring reminder that one can go from 'daydreaming about sex and revolution' to making them reality."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"In this touching and timely memoir, Cleve relives his fascinating life, from adolescent blunders to his conception of the world-famous AIDS Memorial Quilt."&#x2015;<b><i>Brit + Co<br></i></b><br><br>"Essential reading."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Village Voice</i></i></b><br><br>"Jones takes readers on his thrilling, if perilous, voyage from fey, long-haired teen hitching his way from his home in Arizona to San Francisco, to becoming the mentee of Harvey Milk ...

From nineteenth-century bans on indigenous ceremonial practices to twenty-first-century legal battles over sacred lands, peyote use, and hunting practices, the U.S. government has often acted as if Indian traditions were somehow not truly religious and therefore not eligible for the constitutional protections of the First Amendment. In this book, Tisa Wenger shows that cultural notions about what constitutes "religion" are crucial to public debates over religious freedom.<br><br>In the 1920s, Pueblo Indian leaders in New Mexico and a sympathetic coalition of non-Indian reformers successfully challenged government and missionary attempts to suppress Indian dances by convincing a skeptical public that these ceremonies counted as religion. This struggle for religious freedom forced the Pueblos to employ Euro-American notions of religion, a conceptual shift with complex consequences within Pueblo life. Long after the dance controversy, Wenger demonstrates, dominant concepts of religion and religious freedom have continued to marginalize indigenous traditions within the United States.<br><br></p><p>"Although the debate is not well remembered today, the Pueblo Dances affair is one of the most important legal and political conflicts over religious freedom in American history. In this well-researched study, Tisa Wenger does a fine job of describing the affair and vividly highlights the cast of activists on both sides."--Philip Jenkins, author of <i>Dream Catchers: How Mainstream America Discovered Native Spirituality</i> <br>Tisa Wenger is assistant professor of American religious history at Yale University.</p><h2>Master of Desire (MacAllister Series, 1)</h2><p><p>With the success of Kinley MacGregor's latest <em>New York Ti</em>mes Expanded and <em>USA Today</em> bestseller <em>A Dark Champion</em>, we are in the perfect position to republish her backlist gem <em>Master of Desire</em>.</p><p>A Dream of Desire Awakened . . .</p><p>Beautiful Lady Emily dreams of the rapture of love and the joys of marriage.

A dreamer, a romantic, an aesthete, in 1914 he leaves to study medicine in France, and falls in love. When Midhat returns to Nablus to find it under British rule, and the entire region erupting with nationalist fervor, he must find a way to cope with his conflicting loyalties and the expectations of his community. The story of Midhat&#x2019;s life develops alongside the idea of a nation, as he and those close to him confront what it means to strive for independence in a world that seems on the verge of falling apart.<br><br>Against a landscape of political change that continues to define the Middle East, <i>The Parisian</i> explores questions of power and identity, enduring love, and the uncanny ability of the past to disrupt the present.

This is just a great novel, and Isabella Hammad is an ambitions, sensitive, and abundantly talented writer. <em>The Parisian</em> is the story of Midhat Kamal. We first meet him in 1914 Marseilles, while he is on his way to Montpelier to attend medical school. He is also about to fall in love for the first time. Within a year, he is studying in Paris, absorbing the culture; but as a Palestinian living in France, he is always an outsider. Eventually, Midhat returns to his hometown of Nablus, where his father, a wealthy textile merchant, rules his days, and where Britain now rules the land. Midhat must answer to his father&#x2019;s expectations at the same time that he is trying to make his way in a changing Palestine&#x2014;and still there are tendrils that reach back to France. <em>The Parisian</em> is, almost unbelievably, a debut novel&#x2014;a moving personal story set against a sweeping historical backdrop&#x2014;and Isabella Hammad is an exciting new voice in literature. <em>--Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em>ISABELLA HAMMAD was born in London.

Detailed study and meditation of each card may release internally all that is involved with each level encountered on the journey towards the Light. These cards may be used in conjunction with the text or separately for meditation. When studied individually, a card can reveal the necessary steps that need to be taken to actualise one&#39;s potential. Tarot cards, or symbolic representations of the truth have always been used to help man relate not only with the mind, but internally, through the feelings invoked by the colours and forms.The nature of these cards is that they can produce a strong awakening of one&#39;s unconscious forces. They are like a spiritual mirror in which we can recognise and examine ourselves. We can then understand that the reasons for our fate lie within ourselves, and changes by the mere fact that we begin to react differently to everything that happens to us. These cards with the text are a valuable key to understand our present state, our past and in a deeper sense, how we create our future. Included in the book are 22 pages of five-colour tarot illustrations.</p><p>Through her best selling book INITIATION, Elisabeth Haich is world famous for her profound understanding of the human soul and her ability to assist others on their path of actualization.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Olympians: Hades: Lord of the Dead (Olympians, 4)</h2><p><p>Volume 4 of the highly acclaimed Olympians series! </p><p><i>Hades: Lord of the Dead </i>tells the story of the great God of the Underworld and one of the most famous of all Greek myths: Hades' abduction of Persephone and her mother's revenge.

Although Warthrop also considers the Wendigo to be fictitious, he relents and rescues her husband from death and starvation, and then sees the man transform into a Wendigo. Can the doctor and Will Henry hunt down the ultimate predator, who, like the legendary vampire, is neither living nor dead, whose hunger for human flesh is never satisfied? This second book in The Monstrumologist series explores the line between myth and reality, love and hate, genius and madness.</p><p>Rick Yancey is the author of <i>The Monstrumologist</i>, <i>The Curse of the Wendigo</i>, <i>The Isle of Blood</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Final Descent</i>.

I set down the pen nearly a year ago, swearing I would never pick it up again. Let it die with me, I thought. I am an old man. I owe the future nothing.<br><br>Soon I will fall asleep and I will wake from this terrible dream. The endless night will fall, and I will rise.<br><br>I long for that night. I do not fear it.<br><br>I have had my fill of fear. I have stared too long into the abyss, and now the abyss stares back at me.<br><br>Between the sleeping and the waking, it is there.<br><br>Between the rising and the resting, it is there.<br><br>It is always there.<br><br>It gnaws my heart. It chews my soul.<br><br>I turn aside and see it. I stop my ears and hear it. I cover myself and feel it.<br><br>There are no human words for what I mean.<br><br>It is the language of the bare bough and the cold stone, pronounced in the fell wind&#x2019;s sullen whisper and the metronomic <i>drip-drip</i> of the rain. It is the song the falling snow sings and the discordant clamor of sunlight ripped apart by the canopy and miserly filtered down.<br><br>It is what the unseeing eye sees. It is what the deaf ear hears.<br><br>It is the romantic ballad of death&#x2019;s embrace; the solemn hymn of offal dripping from bloody teeth; the lamentation of the bloated corpse rotting in the sun; and the graceful ballet of maggots twisting in the ruins of God&#x2019;s temple.<br><br>Here in this gray land, we have no name. We are the carcasses reflected in the yellow eye.<br><br>Our bones are bleached within our skin; our empty sockets regard the hungry crow.<br><br>Here in this shadow country, our tinny voices scratch like a fly&#x2019;s wing against unmoving air.<br><br>Ours is the language of imbeciles, the gibberish of idiots. The root and the vine have more to say than us.<br><br>I want to show you something. There is no name for it; it has no human symbol. It is old and its memory is long. It knew the world before we named it.<br><br>It knows everything. It knows me and it knows you.<br><br>And I will show it to you.<br><br>I will show you.<br><br>Let us go then, you and I, like Alice down the rabbit hole, to a time when there still were dark places in the world, and there were men who dared to delve into them.<br><br>An old man, I am a boy again.<br><br>And dead, the monstrumologist lives.<br><br>He was a solitary man, a dweller in silences, a genius enslaved to his own despotic thought, meticulous in his work, careless in his appearance, given to bouts of debilitating melancholia and driven by demons as formidable as the physical monstrosities he pursued.<br><br>He was a hard man, obstinate, cold to the point of cruelty, with impenetrable motives and rigid expectations, a strict taskmaster and an exacting teacher when he didn&#x2019;t ignore me altogether. Days would pass with but a word or two between us. I might have been another stick of dusty furniture in a forgotten room of his ancestral home. If I had fled, I do not doubt weeks would have passed before he would have noticed. Then, without warning, I would find myself the sole focus of his attention, a singularly unpleasant phenomenon that produced an effect not unlike the sensation of drowning or being crushed by a thousand-pound rock. Those dark, strangely backlit eyes would turn upon me, the brow would furrow, the lips tighten and grow white, the same expression of intense concentration I had seen a hundred times at the necropsy table as he flayed open some nameless thing to explore its innards. A look from him could lay me bare. I spent many a useless hour debating with myself which was worse, being ignored by him or being acknowledged.<br><br>But I remained. He was all I had, and I do not flatter myself when I say I was all that he had. The fact is, to his death, I was his sole companion.<br><br>That had not always been the case.<br><br>He was a solitary man, but he was no hermit. In those waning days of the century, the monstrumologist was much in demand. Letters and telegrams arrived daily from all over the world seeking his advice, inviting him to speak, appealing to him for this or that service. He preferred the field to the laboratory and would drop everything at a moment&#x2019;s notice to investigate a sighting of some rare species; he always kept a packed suitcase and a field kit in his closet.<br><br>He looked forward to the colloquium of the Monstrumologist Society held annually in New York City, where for two weeks scientists of the same philosophical bent met to present papers, exchange ideas, share discoveries, and, as was their counterintuitive wont, close down every bar and saloon on the island of Manhattan. Perhaps this was not so incongruous, though. These were men who pursued things from which the vast majority of their fellows would run as fast as their legs would carry them. The hardships they endured in this pursuit almost necessitated some kind of Dionysian release. Warthrop was the exception. He never touched alcohol or tobacco or any mind-altering drug. He sneered at those he considered slaves to their vices, but he was no different&#x2014;only his vice was. In fact, one might argue his was the more dangerous by far. It was not the fruit of the vine that killed Narcissus, after all.<br><br>The letter that arrived late in the spring of 1888 was just one of many received that day&#x2014;an alarming missive that, upon coming into his possession, quickly came to possess him.<br><br>Postmarked in New York City, it read:<br><br><i>My Dear Dr. Warthrop,</i><br><br><i>I have it upon good authority that his Hon. Pres. von Helrung intends to present the enclosed Proposal at the annual Congress in New York this November instant. That he is the author of this outrageous proposition, I have no doubt, and I would not trouble you if I possessed so much as a scintilla of uncertainty.</i><br><br><i>The man has clearly gone mad. I care as little about that as I care for the man, but my fear is not unjustified, I think. I consider his insidious argument a genuine threat to the legitimacy of our vocation, with the potential to doom our work to oblivion or&#x2014;worse&#x2014;to doom us to sharing space in the public mind with the charlatan and the quack. Thus, I vouch it is no hyperbole to aver that the very future of our discipline is at stake.</i><br><br><i>Once you have read this offensive tripe, I am certain you will agree that our only hope lies in delivering a forceful Reply upon the completion of his Presentation. And I can think of no better man to contest our esteemed president&#x2019;s alarming and dangerous disquisitions than you, Dr. Warthrop, the leading Philosopher of Aberrant Natural History of his generation.</i><br><br><i>I remain, as always, etc., etc.,</i><br><br><i>Your Obt. Servant,</i><br><br><i>A Concerned Colleague</i><br><br>A single reading of the enclosed monograph of Abram von Helrung convinced the doctor that his correspondent was correct in at least one regard. The proposal did indeed pose a threat to the legitimacy of his beloved profession. That he was the best&#x2014;and obvious&#x2014;choice to refute the claims of the most renowned monstrumologist in the world required no convincing on anyone&#x2019;s part. Pellinore Warthrop&#x2019;s genius included the profound insight that he happened to be one.<br><br>So everything was put aside. Visitors were turned away. Letters went unanswered. All invitations were declined. His studies were abandoned. Sleep and sustenance were reduced to the barest minimum. His thirty-seven-page monograph, with the rather unwieldy title, <i>Shall We Doom the Natural Philosophy of Monstrumology to the Dustbin of History? A Reply to the Hon. President Dr. Abram von Helrung upon His Proposal to Investigate and Consider as Possible Inclusions into the Catalogue of Aberrant Species Certain Heretofore Mythical Creatures of Supernatural Origin at the One Hundred Tenth Congress of the Society for the Advancement of the Science of Monstrumology</i>, went through multiple revisions and refinements over that frantic summer.<br><br>He enlisted me in the cause, naturally, as his research assistant, in addition to my duties as cook, maid, manservant, laundryman, and errand boy. I fetched books, took dictation, and played audience to his stiff, overly formal, sometimes ludicrously awkward presentation. He would stand ramrod straight with his lanky arms folded stiffly behind his back, eyes focused unerringly upon the floor, chin tilted downward so that his otherwise compellingly dark features were lost in shadow.<br><br>He refused to read directly from his paper, so he often &#x201c;went up&#x201d; in the parlance of the theater, completely losing track of his argument, thrashing like King Pellinore, his namesake, in the dense thicket of his thoughts in search of the elusive Questing Beast of his reasoning.<br><br>At other times he fell into rambling asides that took the audience from the birth of monstrumology in the early eighteenth century (beginning with Bacqueville de la Potherie, the acknowledged father of this most curious of esoteric disciplines) to the present day, with references to obscure personages whose voices had long been stifled in the Dark Angel&#x2019;s smothering embrace.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, where was I, Will Henry?&#x201d; he would ask after one of these extended extemporaneities. It never failed that this question came at the precise moment when my mind had wandered to more interesting matters, more often than not to the current weather conditions or the menu for our long-overdue supper.<br><br>Unwilling to incur his inestimable ire, I would fumble a reply, blurting the best guess I had, which usually included somewhere in the sentence the name of Darwin, Warthrop&#x2019;s personal hero.<br><br>The ploy did not always work.<br><br>&#x201c;Darwin!&#x201d; the monstrumologist cried once in reply, striking his fist into his palm in agitation. &#x201c;Darwin! Really, Will Henry, what does Darwin have to do with the native folklore of the Carpathians? Or the mythos of Homer? Or Norse cosmology? Have I not impressed upon you the importance of this endeavor? If I should fail in this, the seminal moment of my career, not only will I go down in humiliation and disrepute, but the entire house will fall! The end of monstrumology, the immediate and irrevocable loss of nearly two hundred years of unselfish devotion by men who <i>dwarf</i> all those who came after them, myself included. Even me, Will Henry. Think of that!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it was . . . You were talking about the Carpathians, I think . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dear Lord! I <i>know</i> that, Will Henry. And the only reason <i>you</i> know that is I just said it!&#x201d;<br><br>As hard as he threw himself into the task of his oral presentation, more assiduously still did he labor over his written reply, composing at least twelve drafts, each of them in his nearly illegible scrawl, and all of which fell to me to transcribe into readable form, for, if the reply had been delivered to the printer&#x2019;s in its original state, it would undoubtedly have been wadded up and hurled at my head.<br><br>Upon the conclusion of my hours of toil, hunching over my desk like a medieval monk with aching ink-stained fingers and itching, burning eyes, the monstrumologist would snatch the product from my quivering grip and compare it to the original, hunting for the slightest error, which, of course, he would invariably find.<br><br>At the end of this Herculean effort, after the printer delivered the finished product and there was little left to do (and little left of the monstrumologist, for he must have lost more than fifteen pounds since the project had begun) but wait for that fall&#x2019;s convocation, he fell into a profound depression. The monstrumologist retreated to his shuttered study, where he brooded in a gloom both actual and metaphysical, refusing to even acknowledge my halfhearted attempts to alleviate his suffering. I brought him raspberry scones (his favorite) from the baker&#x2019;s. I shared with him the latest gossip gleaned from the society pages (he held a strange fascination for them) and the local doings of our little hamlet of New Jerusalem. He would not be comforted. He even lost interest in the mail, which I arranged for him, unread, upon his desk, until the desk&#x2019;s surface was covered as thickly as the forest floor by the leaves of autumn.<br><br>Near the end of August, a large package arrived from Menlo Park, and for a few moments he was his old self again, delighting in the gift from his friend. Enclosed with it was a brief note: <i>All my thanks for your help with the design, Thos. A. Edison</i>. He played with the phonograph for the space of an hour, and then touched it no more. It sat upon the table beside him like a silent rebuke. Here was the dream made real of Thomas Edison, a man who was destined to be lauded as one of the greatest minds of his generation, if not in all history, a true man of science whose world would be forever changed for his having lived in it.<br><br>&#x201c;What am I, Will Henry?&#x201d; the doctor asked abruptly one rainy afternoon.<br><br>I answered with the literalness of a child, which, of course, at the time I was.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a monstrumologist, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am a mote of dust,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Who will remember me when I am gone?&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced at the mountain of letters upon his desk. What did he mean? It seemed he knew everyone. Just that morning a letter had arrived from the Royal Society of London. Sensing he meant something deeper, I answered intuitively, &#x201c;I will, sir. I will remember you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You! Well, I suppose you won&#x2019;t have much choice in the matter.&#x201d; His eyes wandered to the phonograph. &#x201c;Do you know it was not always my desire to be a scientist? When I was much younger, my great ambition was to be a poet.&#x201d;<br><br>If he had stated that his brain were made of Swiss cheese, I would not have been more flabbergasted.<br><br>&#x201c;A poet, Dr. Warthrop?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes. The desire is gone, but the temperament, you may have noticed, still lingers. I was quite the romantic, Will Henry, if you can imagine it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up.&#x201d;<br><br>He placed one of his thin, delicate fingers upon the ceresin cylinder, running the tip along the pits and grooves like a blind man reading braille.<br><br>&#x201c;There is no future in it, Will Henry,&#x201d; he said pensively. &#x201c;The future belongs to science. The fate of our species will be determined by the likes of Edison and Tesla, not Wordsworth or Whitman. The poets will lie upon the shores of Babylon and weep, poisoned by the fruit that grows from the ground where the Muses&#x2019; corpses rot. The poets&#x2019; voices will be drowned out by the gears of progress. I foresee the day when all sentiment is reduced to a chemical equation in our brains&#x2014;hope, faith, even love&#x2014;their exact locations pinned down and mapped out, so we may point to it and say, &#x2018;Here, in this region of our cerebral cortex, lies the soul.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like poetry,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and some like to whittle, Will Henry, so they will always find trees.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you kept any of your poems, Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I have not, for which you should be grateful. I was horrible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you write about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What every poet writes about. I fail to understand it, Will Henry, your uncanny gift for seizing upon the most tangential aspect of the issue and drubbing it to death.&#x201d;<br><br>To prove him wrong, I said, &#x201c;I will never forget you, sir. Ever. And neither will the whole world. You&#x2019;ll be more famous than Edison and Bell and all the rest put together. I&#x2019;ll make sure of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will pass into oblivion, to the vile dust from whence I sprung, unwept, unhonored, and unsung. . . . That is poetry, in case you&#x2019;re wondering.

She lives outside of Atlanta with her family.Rhoda shoved her to-do list into the hidden pocket of her apron and slipped out of the summer kitchen. A brief glance assured her no one was around to see her. She needed a few minutes, however fleeting, without anyone tugging at her. Her shoulders and arms ached as she walked into the orchard.<br><br>She breathed in, and the heady scents of fall and ripe apples helped soothe her frayed nerves. After nearly two months of nurturing the tornado-ravaged orchard, she found the view both uplifting and disheartening. Despite their<br>long, hard days of cleaning up felled trees and mending broken ones, the oncevibrant orchard looked like a battlefield strewn with injured, defeated soldiers.<br><br>Would all of her and Samuel&#x2019;s tending restore the wounded trees? Or simply prolong their dying?<br><br>How strange that she found comfort in walking among these wounded trees. Much of the orchard lay dormant, waiting for late winter, when new trees would be planted.<br><br>But she wouldn&#x2019;t be here for that.<br><br>A ladder rested against a tree where she and Samuel had grafted tree limbs from storm-damaged trees into healthy ones, hoping their grafts would take. It wasn&#x2019;t the right time of year for such work, but they were giving this orchard<br>their all before leaving it behind tomorrow.<br><br>A wavering, misty image stepped out from behind an apple tree.<br><br>Emma.<br><br>The vision appeared real enough, but it wasn&#x2019;t actually her little sister. Emma had been with God since the day she was murdered, since the day Rhoda all but sent her teary-eyed sister to that convenience store by herself at exactly the wrong time. Emma often formed in a visible way, as if Rhoda&#x2019;s guilt over her death was burned so deeply into Rhoda&#x2019;s soul that she would see her sister the rest of her days.<br><br>And maybe she would, but Rhoda dared to hope the move to Maine would end the haunting reminders.<br><br>Emma held out her arms, and Rhoda wished her little sister were truly here to embrace, but all Rhoda could do was watch. And pray.<br><br>Not long after she met Samuel King of Kings&#x2019; Orchard last summer, he asked if she&#x2019;d partner her canning business with his family&#x2019;s apple farming business. When she finally agreed, she did so hoping for several things to come from the agreement. One desire was for the aberrations to remain at home in Morgansville, some thirty miles away&#x2014;and where all memories of Emma had been made.<br><br>But whether Rhoda was here at Kings&#x2019; Orchard or at home with her family, she had yet to be freed of Emma&#x2019;s constant reminders that Rhoda had failed her.<br><br>Would Maine be an escape?<br><br>Emma stretched a hand toward her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me go. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to hold on.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhoda&#x2019;s heart rate increased. Did it do any good to speak her sorrow out loud? &#x201c;I have to move on. Can&#x2019;t you see that?&#x201d;<br><br>Emma&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears, and Rhoda made herself turn away without responding. She walked to the top of a knoll. This orchard would be majestic again in a few years. Still, was Samuel doing the right thing by leaving its future<br>in Eli&#x2019;s hands?<br><br>They would move to Maine tomorrow, to Orchard Bend specifically. Until Samuel went to close on the house a month ago, they had thought the land was in Unity, Maine. But at the closing, Samuel discovered that the farm bordered Unity.<br><br>Once they arrived there tomorrow, they would begin the challenge of restoring an abandoned apple orchard twice the size of this one. The aim was rock solid: reestablish the abandoned orchard in Maine so Kings&#x2019; Orchard and her Rhode Side Stands canning business could bring in the needed profits while this orchard was restored and returned to production.<br><br>But the reality of this venture was terrifying...and exhausting.<br><br>Hoofs rumbled against the earth, and she turned to see Samuel riding the chestnut Morgan toward her. He had the reins in one hand and a five-gallon bucket in the other. The bucket housed what they called their first-aid kit for the trees.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; His lack of a smile as he dismounted didn&#x2019;t surprise her. For every ounce of energy she gave working, he seemed determined to give double. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d find you here where we worked last.&#x201d; He gazed into her eyes for a<br>brief moment. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re tired, and you aren&#x2019;t going to like what I have to say, but could you do me a favor and try to take it well?&#x201d; Without waiting for her to answer, he walked the horse to a nearby tree and tethered it.<br><br>He had her pegged on both counts: bone tired and edgy. They&#x2019;d had more spats in the last few weeks than two alpha dogs sharing a food bowl. Who knew that accomplishing everything on her to-do list would be so draining? Actually, now that she thought about it, the answer to that was Samuel and Jacob. Both had tried to get her to take numerous things off her list, like the experiments of growing herbs and developing mulch under horticultural lights. And both had tried for weeks to stop her from harvesting and canning the apples left by the tornado.<br><br>But she couldn&#x2019;t let apples rot.

How did they know what had happened to her fruit garden? She clutched the letter and shook it at him as he headed back her way.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you take that incident to my bishop and deacon?&#x201d;<br><br>Her family wouldn&#x2019;t. They knew it would stir up trouble for her. Landon wouldn&#x2019;t. He was too loyal a friend. The only other person she&#x2019;d told who was responsible for destroying her fruit garden was Samuel.<br><br>Samuel&#x2019;s jaw set. &#x201c;It needed to be done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But...but you gave me your word.&#x201d; Compelled to read the rest, she returned her attention to the letter.<br><br>Dear Samuel, after much consideration we have prayerfully agreed that the matter you brought to our attention must be addressed. The charges are of such a serious nature that we cannot allow Rhoda Byler to go to Maine as a member in good standing unless this matter is settled first.<br><br>Since this matter needs to be settled before Rhoda leaves for Maine, and since your concern is that Rueben Glick is not only guilty of this incident but may be causing problems with others as well, we feel we have no choice but to allow this meeting to be open to anyone in the district who chooses to come.<br><br>Her blood ran hot as realization continued to dawn. Anger began to mingle with fear, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop staring at the letter. Why had the ministers waited until the day before the move to call a meeting? But more important...why would Samuel do this to her?<br><br>Wasn&#x2019;t it bad enough that Rueben Glick and his small band of nitwits had destroyed her fruit garden last August? She had been devastated when she&#x2019;d arrived home with Samuel, Jacob, and Leah to discover what had been done.<br><br>The garden meant the world to Rhoda. Her Daed had given her the first blueberry bush when she was just seven. Every year since then he gave her more plants and land to plant them on. The garden grew and became her sanctuary, especially after her sister was murdered.<br><br>Rhoda had worked year after year to make the garden beautiful and yield a healthy crop. All the naysayers who didn&#x2019;t like her and her odd ways had wanted her out of that garden. Some were jealous, but others were truly concerned that she was overstepping her place as a single Amish woman with too much independence and too much success. The number of stores that carried her canned products only increased. If she were married, those against her would probably feel different. Then again, if she were married, she wouldn&#x2019;t have the time to devote to her business, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be so successful.<br><br>For more reasons than she could explain, it meant everything to her to conceal from her community and neighbors that Rueben had uprooted her beloved vines and bushes. So she had called her friend Landon and asked him to bring over his Bobcat. By morning the land looked as if she had deliberately cleared her garden.</p><h2>The Untamed Tongue: A Dissenting Dictionary</h2><p><p>This is a new collection of biting aphorisms and provocative meditations by the master iconoclast of our age. Of <em>The Untamed Tongue</em> Szasz says: "I have tried, in the tradition of Voltaire's <em> Philosophical Dictionary</em>, to present a satirical overview of the current state of the 'human comedy' <em>&#x2014;</em> with special emphasis on psychiatry, therapy, and related follies."<br> <br> The entries in this heretical 'dictionary' are arranged under such headings as ethics, liberty, love, money, politics, psychiatry, psychotherapy, punishment, religion, sex, social relations, and suicide. They all reveal Szasz at his courageous and outrageous best, as he takes on the government's futile and murderous 'war on drugs', exposes the hypocrisies of psychotherapy and the atrocities of psychiatry, and defends the individual's most sacred right <em>&#x2014;</em> the right to suicide.</p></p><p></p><h2>Sarajevo Blues</h2><p><p>From one of Bosnia&#x2019;s most prominent poets and writers: spare and haunting stories and poems that were written under the horrific circumstances of the recent war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

Semezdin Mehmedinovic says that writing is, finally, quite a personal thing that doesn&#x2019;t make much sense unless you are practicing for the last word.&#x201d; For those Bosnians emerging from the siege or still in exile, these last words&#x201d; remain intimate possessions, one of the last bastions left against the commodification of tragedy.</p><p>"<i>Sarajevo Blues</i> is widely considered here to be the best piece of writing to emerge from this besieged capital since Bosnia's war erupted in April 1992." <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"A Supreme masterpiece witnessed and redeems with total detachment.

The film was presented at the Berlin Film Festival in 1994, and won the first prize at the Mediterranean Festival in Rome the following year.

Arguing against those who think Paul was an apostate from Judaism, Nanos maintains Paul&#39;s continuity with his Jewish heritage. Several key arguments here are: Those addressed in Paul&#39;s letter were still an integral part of the Roman synagogue communities. The &#34;weak&#34; are non- Christian Jews, while the &#34;strong&#34; included both Jewish and gentile converts to belief in Jesus. Paul as a practicing devout Jew insists on the rules of behavior for &#34;the righteous gentiles.&#34; Christian subordination to authorities (Romans 13:1-7) is intended to enforce submission to leaders of the synagogues, not Roman government officials. Paul behaves in a way to confirm the very Jewish portrait of him in Acts: going first to the synagogues.</p><p></p><h2>I Saw Elvis in My Ultrasound (Baby Blues Collection)</h2><p><p> ""Let's name the baby Lexus!

Drawing upon years of research, including his own collecting of synagogue and folk songs in Middle Eastern and European Jewish communities, the author examines the music as a tonal expression of Judaism and Jewish life, containing original elements and features reflecting the spiritual aspects of Jewish culture.<br>The song of the synagogue is traced from its origins in the Middle East through its evolution there and throughout the cultures of Eastern, Central, and Western Europe and the United States. The mystical songs of the Chassidim, the traditions of the Badchonim and Klezmorim, and other important aspects of the history of Jewish folk music are covered in detail as well.<br>The book is written not only for scholars and musicians but also for lay persons interested in a serious study of the subject. Technical sections are printed in smaller type, and non-English terms are defined. The book is liberally illustrated with every type of music discussed. A new introduction by noted scholar Arbie Orenstein highlights the book's enduring values and significance. For musicologists, ethnographers, and students of Jewish history and culture, this fascinating book remains the most comprehensive one-volume study of the development and meaning of Jewish music over a thousand years of history.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Four New Messages</h2><p><p><b>A quartet of audacious fictions that capture the pathos and absurdity of life in the age of the internet</b></p><p><i>*A</i> New York Times Book<i> Review Editors' Choice*</i><br><i>* </i>One of Flavorwire's "50 Books That Define the Past Five Years in Literature"</p><p>A spectacularly talented young writer has returned from the present with <i>Four New Messages</i>, urgent and visionary dispatches that seek to save art, sex, and even alienation from corporatism and technology run rampant.</p><p>In "Emission," a hapless drug dealer in Princeton is humiliated when a cruel co-ed exposes him exposing himself on a blog gone viral. "McDonald's" tells of a frustrated pharmaceutical copywriter whose imaginative flights fail to bring solace because of a certain word he cannot put down on paper. In "The College Borough" a father visiting NYU with his daughter remembers a former writing teacher, a New Yorker exiled to the Midwest who refuses to read his students' stories, asking them instead to build a replica of the Flatiron Building. "Sent" begins mythically in the woods of Russia, but in a few virtuosic pages plunges into the present, where an aspiring journalist finds himself in a village that shelters all the women who've starred in all the internet porn he's ever enjoyed.</p><p>Highbrow and low-down, these four intensely felt stories explain what happens when the virtual begins to colonize the real -- they harness the torrential power and verbal dexterity that have established Cohen as one of America's most brilliant younger writers.</p></p><p><p><b>Joshua Cohen</b> was born in 1980 in New Jersey. He is the author of five books, including <i>A Heaven of Others</i> and <i>Witz</i>. His nonfiction has appeared in <i>Bookforum</i>, <i>The Forward</i>, <i>Harper's</i> and other publications. He lives in New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;Cohen, a key member of the United States' under-40 writers' club (along with Nell Freudenberger and Jonathan Safran Foer), is a rare talent who makes highbrow writing fun and accessible.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marie Claire</i></p><p>&#x201c;Powerfully strange. . . . Mr. Cohen's stories are about a lot of things: sex, family, disappointment, literary frustration. . . . But in his new collection, <i>Four New Messages</i>, he nestles these subjects inside a more expansive obsession: how the series of tubes we call the Web has recast, often in sick ways, his contemporaries' sense of who and where and why they are. . . . [T]o sum this up in Web terms, he'll make you want to be an angel investor in his stuff. What's a book but a public offering? You'll want to be in on the ground floor.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dwight Garner, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Cohen has] manifold talents at digging under and around absurdity. . . . Language--not elision--is the primary material of Cohen's oeuvre, and his method of negotiating his way toward meaning is like powering straight through a thick wall of words. . . . The reward is an off-kilter precision, one that feels both untainted and unique.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rachel Kushner, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Smart and well conceived.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;All these stories are replete with clever turns of phrase and memorable lines. . . . Like [David Foster] Wallace, Cohen is clearly concerned with the depersonalizing effects of technology, broken people doing depraved things, and how the two intersect in tragic (and, sometimes, hilarious) ways. The franticness with which he writes about these themes is, at times, Wallace-esque--sentences screaming across the page turbulently, always seemingly one wrong turn from flying apart altogether.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Another exhilarating spectacle from a virtuosic wordsmith.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Star Tribune (Minneapolis)</i></p><p>&#x201c;The four novellas included are certainly new--I've never read anything remotely like them--and they're certainly messages, urgent ones addressed to the porn-numb but as yet un-lobotomized members of the iGeneration. Cohen calls out in pimped-out prose that shimmies like a lowride Cutlass. I would advise you all to listen.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Wilson, Salon, "Salon's Ultimate Book Guide"</i></p><p>&#x201c;In Mr. Cohen's hands, a meme is a matter of life and death, because he goes from the reality we all know<i>--</i>the link, the click<i>--</i>to the one we tend to forget: the human. . . . Mr. Cohen is ambitious. He is mapping terra incognita.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Immoderately brilliant. . . . Throughout, Cohen uses his gifts extravagantly, but there are no lazy formulations, no banal phrases that he doesn't either parody or somehow subvert, and by so doing create a new angle of perception that demands close rereading. . . . <i>Four New Messages</i> might seem an ambitious title in an era when true literary innovation is rare, but Joshua Cohen exceeds expectations in ways that are gratifying in the present and promising for the future.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookforum</i></p><p>&#x201c;There is ample evidence that Joshua Cohen is one of the greatest literary minds of his generation. . . . If anything is finally going to get people to admit that he's the new Thomas Pynchon (sans the whole recluse thing) the Graywolf Press published book will be it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Flavorpill</i></p><p>&#x201c;Cohen's comically dense ruminations don't so much as come to a boil as spill over with tales of pornography, hyperviolent video games, consumerism, and depression.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Interview</i></p><p>&#x201c;Joshua Cohen has more than four new messages to deliver in this volatile book, all quite urgent. These stories seize us with their brash humor and intellectual reach. But are they startling warning flares or diabolical soul traps?

Fielding, founder of the Bow Street Runners police force, then recruits young Jeremy in his mission to fight London's most wicked crimes.</p><p>Bruce Alexander is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and non-fiction. The previous books in this series are <b>Blind Justice, Murder in Grub Street </b>(Named by <b>The New York Times Book Review</b> as a Notable Book in 1995), <b>Watery Grave, Person or Persons Unknown</b> (named by the <b>Chicago Tribune</b> as one of the best novels of 1997), <b>Jack, Knave and Fool</b>, and <b>Death of a Colonial</b>.Sir John Fielding, co-founder with his late half-brother Henry (author of Tom Jones) of the Bow Street Runners, has been dead for 200 years, but he's just now getting his first starring role in a detective story. Here, in 1768, the blind magistrate rescues orphaned printer's apprentice Jeremy Proctor from a trumped-up robbery charge just in time to take Jeremy along as his youthful Watson while he investigates the apparent suicide of Lord Richard Goodhope, shot inside a locked library. Surprises abound, even for the seasoned Sir John: Lord Goodhope, who was on distant terms with his wife, died of poison, not his gunshot; the library is not quite so hermetically sealed as it appears; notorious gambler Black Jack Bilbo claims to hold Goodhope's markers for &#x153;12,000; one of his footmen left Goodhope's employ very recently, only to turn up in quite another connection. Even Mary Deemey, the invincibly English dressmaker who supplied widow's weeds to Goodhope's current actress companion, is masquerading as one Mlle. Claudette. But though he constantly has to ask Jeremy to describe things and places and people for him, nothing fools Sir John, and his clever identification of a suspect sets the stage for an old-fashioned denouement in the Goodhope library. Pseudonymous Alexander's debut wraps a competent mystery in a historical narrative of vivacity and charm. The final paragraph promises a sequel, perhaps a series. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Do we read nonfiction in order to receive information, or do we read it to experience art? It's not very clear sometimes. This, then, is a book that tries to offer a clear objective: I am here in search of art. I am here to track the origins of an alternative to commerce.</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>John D'Agata leaves no tablet unturned in his exploration of the roots of the essay. <i>The Lost Origins of the Essay</i> takes the reader from ancient Mesopotamia to classical Greece and Rome, from fifth-century Japan to nineteenth-century France, to modern Brazil, Germany, Barbados, and beyond. With brief and brilliant introductions to seminal works by Heraclitus, Sei Sho-nagon, Michel de Montaigne, Jonathan Swift, Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras, Octavio Paz, and more than forty other luminaries, D'Agata reexamines the international forebears of today's American nonfiction. This idiosyncratic collection makes a perfect historical companion to D'Agata's <i>The Next American</i> Essay, a touchstone among students and practitioners of the lyric essay.</p></p><p><p><b>John D'Agata</b> is the author of <i>Halls of Fame</i> and the editor of <i>The Next American Essay</i>. He teaches in the nonfiction writing program at the University of Iowa and is the editor of lyric essays for <i>Seneca Review</i>.</p>From Ziusudra of Sumer to Antonin Artaud and beyond, the essay in all its glory is on full display in this ingenious anthology. The title doesn't convey the volume's range&#x2014;the spirit of factual expression, worked on by the imagination, transplanted into many times and in many cultures. This is a book to dip into or read through, certainly to savor for its diversity. The essay tent is wide, and under D'Agata's (<i>Halls of Fame</i>) editorship and astute eye it includes hybrid forms, from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell through the prose poems of Aloysius Bertrand, Baudelaire and Mallarm� to a performative essay on Bob Marley by Kamau Brathwaite. Readers will be familiar with the aphorisms of Francis Bacon, somewhat less familiar with the eccentric virtuosity of Sir Thomas Browne and much more so with Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal. But readers are perhaps most likely to be turned on for the first time by the prose artistry of Matsuo Basho, the avant-garde musings of Clarice Lispector on the (not-so) simple egg and the obsessive documentarylike musings of Marguerite Duras. Overall, this imaginative international collection showcases the art of short nonfiction at its best. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From reducing stress and improving posture to balance and general mobility, the many physical and mental benefits of Qigong and Tai Chi are widely celebrated. In this accessible book, Mimi Kuo-Deemer offers practices, insights and wisdom on these arts, and shows us how to support our natural capacity for energy, balance and wellbeing. Qigong&#39;s approach is based on the Chinese Five Elements or Phases of wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Each natural element relates to an organ and meridian system in the body, and Qigong and the Tai Chi Axis will explore each of these elements as they relate to our physical, mental and emotional health. It also will include popular and widely practiced sequences and forms such as the 8 Brocades, Five Animal Frolics, Tai Chi Qigong 18 Forms and Five Element Qigong practices and explore how these lead to wholeness, nourishment and health.Part I: Wood Element: Nourishing our Roots Part 2: Fire Element: Nourishing the Heart Part 3: Earth Element: Nourishing the Mind Part 4: Metal Element: Nourishing the SpiritPart 5: Water Element: Nourishing our Deepest Wisdom</p><p></p><h2>Three Views on Eastern Orthodoxy and Evangelicalism (Counterpoints)</h2><p><p>To some Western evangelicals, the practices of Eastern Orthodoxy seem mysterious and perhaps even unbiblical. Then again, from an Orthodox perspective, evangelicals lack the spiritual roots provided by centuries-old church traditions. Are the differences between these two branches of Christianity so sharp that to shake hands is to compromise the gospel itself? Or is there room for agreement? Are Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelicalism at all compatible? Yes, no, maybe&#x2015;this book allows five leading authorities to present their different views, have them critiqued by their fellow authors, and respond to the critiques. Writing from an Orthodox perspective with a strong appreciation for evangelicalism, Bradley Nassif makes a case for compatibility. Michael Horton and Vladimir Berzonsky take the opposite stance from their respective evangelical and Orthodox backgrounds. And George Hancock-Stefan (evangelical) and Edward Rommen (Orthodox) each offer a qualified &#x201c;perhaps.&#x201d; The interactive Counterpoints forum is ideal for comparing and contrasting the different positions to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these two important branches of Christianity and to form a personal conclusion regarding their compatibility.

YES The Evangelical Theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church Bradley Nassif ARE EASTERN ORTHODOXY AND EVANGELICALISM COMPATIBLE? YES The Evangelical Theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church Bradley Nassif SETTING THE STAGE: A PERSONAL WORD If postmodernism has taught us anything, it has made us aware that we always interpret reality through the eyes of our own history---our family upbringing, educational background, cultural context, and religious community. My background is deeply rooted in the Eastern Orthodox tradition. I am a Lebanese Christian who grew up in America in the Antiochian Orthodox Church (formally named the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and All the East, whose patriarch resides in Damascus, Syria). It is among the most ancient and revered patriarchates in the Orthodox world, dating back to the great christological controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries---and even back to the first century, where the New Testament reports in Acts 11:26 that &#39;the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.&#39; The late Father John Meyendorff was my doctoral mentor with whom I specialized in Greek patristic theology and exegesis. I am also deeply indebted to evangelical Christians who helped bring me into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ during my high school years. Over the past decade I have been a visiting or adjunct professor of Orthodox studies at leading evangelical schools such as Fuller Theological Seminary, Regent College, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Much of my work has been devoted to introducing evangelical students and faculty to the riches of the Eastern Orthodox tradition, and many of these evangelicals have become friends and colleagues. In the early 1990s I founded a Pan-Orthodox, Pan-Evangelical organization named the Society for the Study of Eastern Orthodoxy and Evangelicalism. For the past decade we&#39;ve held annual meetings to explore the areas of convergence and divergence between our two traditions. I share these brief biographical excerpts because readers may appreciate knowing that I have not just thought about Orthodox and evangelical compatibility, but I&#39;ve lived it most of my life. I&#39;m also convinced that my personal history has been a theological asset to the exposition of Orthodox theology, not a confessional liability, because it has given me firsthand knowledge of the very best and the very worst in the Orthodox and evangelical worlds. There are plenty of negative experiences one could point to on both sides, by virtue of which one could argue that the positive stance I&#39;ve adopted here is nothing more than wishful thinking. I know as an insider how disillusioning it can be to see how deep and widespread the ignorance of Orthodox Church members can be concerning their own faith, how low their levels of personal commitment sometimes are, and how bigoted they sometimes act toward other Christians. On the other hand, I have witnessed the hubris of some evangelical Christians, which is often tied to historical amnesia and an idolatrous self-confidence in their own exegetical skills. I&#39;ve also been a deeply wounded casualty of the broken promises and highly unethical behavior of certain evangelical leaders. But I must quickly add that the good in both communities far outweighs the bad. So I write this chapter under no romantic illusions. I bring to this essay both an intimate academic knowledge and an intimate experiential knowledge of both communities, from the top down and the bottom up. It is precisely because of---and in spite of---these many perspective-shaping experiences that I am quite certain our two traditions will never see full communion in my lifetime (barring an intervention by the Holy Spirit). I&#39;m not sure there should even be full communion. But in order to lay a common ground for mutual exploration and to increase the level of theological communication between our two estranged communities, I accepted the invitation to participate in this volume by identifying areas of convergence and divergence through a brief overview of the evangelical theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church. SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT I HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH Goals I have three goals for this chapter: (1) to define evangelical identity and use the definition to measure the common ground between Eastern Orthodox and Protestant evangelical theology;1 (2) to see how the distinctive theological themes that comprise the identity of contemporary evangelicalism were interpreted by the classical tradition of the Greek church fathers from the fourth to the fourteenth centuries; and (3) to assess the similarities and differences between the classical and contemporary versions of the evangelical faith as the basis for viewing the extent of conflict and compatibility between both the Orthodox and the Protestant evangelical communities today. Method The strength of our conclusions will depend largely on the reliability of the research method applied. My procedure will not try to address the distressing diversity of evangelicalism but to constructively set forth our common consent to the evangelical faith in a way that is faithful to the Orthodox vision of life in Christ. I will contend that there are no core disagreements between evangelicals and Eastern Orthodox over the issues that define the evangelical movement, issues that are also present in the Eastern Orthodox Church. There are major differences, however, over the The Evangelical Theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church | 29 1The best supplementary reading to this chapter is Donald Fairbairn&#39;s Eastern Orthodoxy Through Western Eyes (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 2002). A comprehensive summary in one convenient location of all known sources, leaders, and dialogues dealing with Orthodoxy and evangelicalism between 1990 and 2003 can be found in Bradley Nassif&#39;s &#39;Eastern Orthodoxy and Evangelicalism: The Status of an Emerging Global Dialogue&#39; in Eastern Orthodox Theology: A Contemporary Reader, rev. ed., ed. Daniel Clendenin (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2003). extent to which the Orthodox understand and manifest, as evangelicals do not, those larger principles of evangelical identity through the church&#39;s incarnational Trinitarian vision of life. I will first carefully define the meaning of the term evangelical and then measure the components of this definition against the theological norms that have guided Orthodox church life for nearly two thousand years: the dogmatic definitions of its church fathers and councils, liturgies, spirituality, iconography, architecture, and mission theology. I&#39;ll discuss contemporary ecumenical documents that have been produced by the Orthodox Church as their official responses to specific doctrinal issues raised in their dialogues with Protestants and Catholics---documents previously unexamined for their relevance to the evangelical movement. I will also briefly document how the current work of leading evangelical scholars has been inadvertently moving the evangelical movement toward a rediscovery of the creative relevance of the Christian East in its classical theology, spirituality, and worship---often far more attractively than we Orthodox are doing for ourselves! Using simultaneously the historical and systematic disciplines to compare Orthodox and evangelical theology runs the obvious risk of generalizing at the expense of analytic research. Given the ecumenical task at hand, however, a panoramic overview of the evangelical theology of the Orthodox Church appears to be what is most urgently needed in order to correct the nearsightedness of those seemingly unable to see the forest for the trees.</p><h2>From Bad Grades to a Great Life!: Unlocking the Mystery of Achievement for Your Child (Love and Logic)</h2><p>Your underachiever can grow-up to have a great life!

What are the special characteristics of contemporary racism? How can it be related to class divisions and to the contradictions of the nation-state? And how far, in turn, does racism today compel us to rethink the relationship between class struggles and nationalism?<br><br>This book attempts to answer these fundamental questions through a remarkable dialogue between the French philosopher Etienne Balibar and the American historian and sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein. Each brings to the debate the fruits of over two decades of analytical work, greatly inspired, respectively, by Louis Althusser and Fernand Braudel. Both authors challenge the commonly held notion of racism as a continuation of, or throwback to, the xenophobias of past societies and communities. They analyze it instead as a social relation indissolubly tied to present social structures&#x2014;the nation-state, the division of labor, and the division between core and periphery&#x2014;which are themselves constantly being reconstructed. Despite their productive disagreements, Balibar and Wallerstein both emphasize the modernity of racism and the need to understand its relation to contemporary capitalism and class struggle. Above all, their dialogue reveals the forms of present and future social conflict, in a world where the crisis of the nation-state is accompanied by an alarming rise of nationalism and chauvinism.</p><p><b>�tienne Balibar</b> is a French Marxist philosopher and the most celebrated student of Louis Althusser.

All understood as well that what was at stake was not a moment's political advantage, but the future course of the American experiment in democracy. In this epochal debate, no two figures loomed larger than Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.</p><p> Both men were visionaries, but their visions of what the United States should be were diametrically opposed. Jefferson, a true revolutionary, believed passionately in individual liberty and a more egalitarian society, with a weak central government and greater powers for the states. Hamilton, a brilliant organizer and tactician, feared chaos and social disorder. He sought to build a powerful national government that could ensure the young nation's security and drive it toward economic greatness. </p><p> Jefferson and Hamilton is the story of the fierce struggle-both public and, ultimately, bitterly personal-between these two titans. It ended only with the death of Hamilton in a pistol duel, felled by Aaron Burr, Jefferson's vice president. Their competing legacies, like the twin strands of DNA, continue to shape our country to this day. Their personalities, their passions, and their bold dreams for America leap from the page in this epic new work from one of our finest historians.</p></p><p><b>John Ferling</b> is professor emeritus of history at the University of West Georgia.

Originally from Australia, he arrived in London in 1980, and proceeded to establish himself both there and in New York for his scene-making clubs and performances until his death in 1994."Leigh Bowery was clearly one of the most eye-poppingly extraordinary figures of our time."

But these adults were also parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles (however they would have codified these kin relationships) who had to make space physically, emotionally, intellectually, and cognitively for the infants, children and adolescents around them. The economic, social, and political roles of Paleolithic children are often understudied because they are assumed to be unknowable or negligible.<br><br>Drawing on the most recent data from the cognitive sciences and from the ethnographic, fossil, archaeological, and primate records, Growing Up in the Ice Age challenges these assumptions. This volume is a timely and evidence-based look at the lived lives of Paleolithic children and the communities of which they were a part. By rendering the &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; children visible, readers will gain a new understanding not only of the contributions that children have made to the biological and cultural entities we are today but also of the Paleolithic period as whole.</p><p>April Nowell is a Paleolithic archaeologist and Professor of Anthropology at the University of Victoria.

But what was the truth about his sex life and sexuality&#x2014;and how did it affect and influence his writing and public life? With In Bed with Gore Vidal: Hustlers, Hollywood, and the Private World of an American Master, Tim Teeman interviews many of Vidal&#x2019;s closest family and friends, including Claire Bloom and Susan Sarandon, as well as surveying Vidal&#x2019;s own rich personal archive, to build a rounded portrait of who this lion of American letters really was away from the page. Here, revealed for the first time, Teeman discovers the Hollywood stars Vidal slept with and the reality of his life with partner Howard Austen&#x2014;and the hustlers they both enjoyed. Was Gore&#x2019;s true love really a boy from prep school? Was he really, as he said, bisexual, and if so how close did he really get to marrying women, including Claire Bloom and Joanne Woodward? And if Vidal really was gay, why did he not want to say so? Did his own sex secrets underpin a legal fight with adversary William F. Buckley, still being played out after his death? Much as Vidal fought against being categorized, Teeman shows how he also proved himself to be a pugnacious advocate for gay sexual freedom in his books, articles, and high-profile media appearances. Teeman also, for the first time, vividly and movingly evokes the final, painful and tragic years of Vidal&#x2019;s life, as he descended into alcoholism and dementia, his death, and the bitter, contentious legacy he has left behind.</p><p>Tim Teeman is a journalist, author and broadcaster. For many years he worked as an editor, feature writer, and interviewer for The Times of London, most recently as their US Correspondent. In Bed with Gore Vidal is his first book.

In this exceptional translation of Bishop Brianchaninov's essay on the Jesus Prayer, we are introduced to a spiritual exercise known as Hesychasm. Hesychasm gives expression to the method of enlightenment that has been in use in Christian monasteries in the East almost from Apostolic times. The practice of Hesychasm falls into three parts: the prayer is repeated aloud to condition the body; then it is prayed silently in order to condition the mind. Finally, when complete concentration has been attained, the prayer is carried down into the heart using the rhythm of the heart beat. Bishop Brianchaninov not only explains how the prayer works and how to prepare for the practice but puts forth several teachings from Greek and Russian mystics on the Jesus Prayer. Among these are St. Barsanouphius, Dorotheus the Russian, and St. Seraphim; St John of the Ladder; St. Nile Sorsky, St. Gregory the Sinaite; St. Nicephorus of Mouth Athos; and St. Kallistus and Ignatius Xanthopoulos. Brianchaninov also discusses the pitfalls that can be encountered along the way and how to avoid them, as well as "material aids," such as the rosary and posture, for the practice.</p><p><p>Ignatius Brianchaninov was an early 19th-century bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. He wrote several essays on asceticism.</p></p><h2>Eat in My Kitchen: To Cook, to Bake, to Eat, and to Treat</h2><p><b>2017 JAMES BEARD AWARD WINNER FOR GENERAL COOKING</b><br><b>Meike Peters, the author of the acclaimed cooking blog <i>Eat in My Kitchen</i>, presents a cookbook as inviting, entertaining, and irresistible as her website, featuring dozens of never-before-published recipes. </b> <br><br>Meike Peters&#x2019;s site, <i>Eat in My Kitchen</i>, captures the way people like to eat now: fresh, seasonal food with a variety of influences.

There are two brief answers given by believers: "everything" and "not much." While evangelical or fundamentalist Christians would find authoritative guidance in the words and commands of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament, many mainstream Christian ethicists would say that Jesus is too concrete or narrowly particular to have any direct import for ethics.In this book, Williams Spohn takes a middle way, showing how Jesus is the "concrete universal" of Christian ethics. By forming a bridge from the lives of contemporary Christians to the words and deeds of Jesus, Jesus' story as a whole exemplifies moral perception, motivation and Christian identity.In addition, Spohn shows how the practices of Christian spirituality--specifically prayer, service, and community--train the imagination and reorient emotions to produce a character and a way of life consonant with Christian New Testament moral teaching.</p></p><p>William C. Spohn is Presidential Professor of Ethics and the Common Good at Santa Clara University."This is a fascinating book...a refreshing combination of academic rigour and intellectual challenge with a clear and genuine desire for practical application and outworking. Spohn has produced a challenging and well-written book, full of nice touches, relevant and insightful anecdotes, and undergirded with a sense of humour."&#x2014;Richard Burridge, King's College London<br><br>"Spohn's situation of virtue ethics in the discipleship of Jesus is a bracing, exhilarating&#x2014;and somewhat alarming&#x2014;one. Catholics have long become comfortable in the detailed rubrics of a highly structured ethical system. We knew what was a sin (and to what degree), and what our responsibilities were in particular circumstances. Spohn, using Jesus' own teachings, suggests that it is more important to ask, 'What has Jesus equipped us for and to what is He calling us?' This is an excellent book and warmly recommended for all libraries....Students of ethics and clergy will appreciate Spohn's important contribution."&#x2014;Catholic Library World<br><br>"Building on the foundations laid in his What Are They Saying about Scripture and Ethics?, Spohn here endeavors to erect a framework for Christian ethics around three interconnecting pillars: 1. the New Testament story of Jesus; 2. the ethics of virtue and character; and 3. the practices of Christian spirituality....Spohn's case for the community practice of spirituality&#x2014;prayer, service, and worship&#x2014;as an integral element of this ethical construction work is compelling, and his illustration of the analogical interpretation of the Gospel stories and Pauline ethical episodes are fresh and insightful. As a text outlining a Christian ethical method, it is recommended for courses in Christian ethics, religious education, moral theology and psychology, pastoral practice, and biblical interpretation."&#x2014;Choice<br><br>"It's interdisciplinary approach shows how the moral vision of Jesus, virtue ethics, and traditional spiritual practices reinforce and depend upon each other, and how all three are necessary for undrstanding the relation between Jesus and ethics. Spohn's work, then, is an exploratory essay that demonstrates how scholars can refresh their areas of specialization by crossing boundaries."&#x2014;Frank J. Materia, Theological Studies<br><br>"Does not focus on one piece of the puzzle of Christian existence but covers the whole terrain in a rich and complex portrait of what it means to be a Christian."&#x2014;Books and Culture<br><br>"Spohn's account offers a major gain over the older casuistic, natural-law-based Catholic moral theology that it seeks to supplant. His emphases on biblical narrative, the centrality of the christological pattern, and the role of analogical imagination in moral discernment are essential features of any Christian ethic that seeks to be faithful to the New Testament witness. His wise exposition of character formation through Christian practices is an important counterpoint to the work of many writers on New Testament ethics . . ."&#x2014;Theology Today, January 2002<br><br>"Clearly and elegantly written, this study displays the pedagogy of a seasoned teacher and the precision of a moral theologian....this book should be read by Protestant and Catholic theologians alike."<br>&#x2014;Journal of the AAR, Sept 2002</p><h2>Thimbleberries (R) Classic Country Christmas: Decorating, Entertaining, and Quilting Inspirations for Celebrating Christmas All Through the House (Landauer) Ornaments, Garlands, Food Crafts, and More</h2><p><p>Luminaria, stars and hearts ornaments, hydrangea garlands, festive food crafts, gifts&#x2014;from greenery to gum drop trees, <i>Thimbleberries(R) Classic Country Christmas</i> combines the best of the old with the new in Lynette Jensen's classic home and family Christmas celebrations.</p><ul><li><b>14 holiday themes</b> such as Santa, stars, gingerbread treats, poinsettias, snowmen, candles, greenery, and more</li><li><b>30 Christmas projects</b> including Thimbleberries(R) quilt and pillow patterns</li><li><b>Step-by-step how to</b> for painted projects, stenciling, mitten trims, Santa ornaments, glitter boxes, and more</li><li><b>Dozens</b> of imaginative tabletop arrangements</li><li><b>200+ color photos</b></li></ul><p></p><p>Get decorating, entertaining, and quilting inspirations for celebrating Christmas all through your home with <i>Thimbleberries Classic Country Christmas</i>!</p></p><p><p>Designer and teacher, Lynette Jensen shares her favorite decorating, entertaining, and quilting inspirations for celebrating Christmas all through the house.

Swanson&#x2014;the Edgar� Award-winning, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>Manhunt</em><em>&#x2014;brings to life two epic events of the Civil War era: </em>the thrilling chase to apprehend Confederate president Jefferson Davis in the wake of the Lincoln assassination and the momentous&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;-day funeral that took Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s body home to Springfield. A true tale full of fascinating twists and turns, and lavishly illustrated with dozens of rare historical images&#x2014;some never before seen&#x2014;<em>Bloody Crimes </em>is a fascinating companion to Swanson&#x2019;s <em>Manhunt </em>and&nbsp;&nbsp;a riveting true-crime thriller that will electrify civil war buffs, general&nbsp;readers, and everyone in between.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: It's April 1865 and General Lee's troops have officially surrendered. Abraham Lincoln, looking forward to rebuilding the nation, celebrates with an evening&#x2014;his last alive&#x2014;at the theater. On the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line Jefferson Davis plans to move the Confederate government to North Carolina, away from Union troops that have captured Richmond. Under much different circumstances, both men embark on a dramatic final journey depicted by James. L. Swanson in <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, a gripping account of the weeks following Lincoln&#x2019;s death and the end of the Civil War. While arguments erupted about where and how Lincoln&#x2019;s burial should take place, Jefferson Davis&#x2014;refusing to let the South succumb&#x2014;attempted to rally his people despite being hunted by Northern troops who suspected his involvement in Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination. Using relics and key documents of the day, Swanson juxtaposes the travels of Davis and Lincoln, weaving a fast-paced narrative that lures readers in from the get-go. We know that eventually Lincoln makes it to his final resting place and Davis is captured, but along the way it&#x2019;s hard not to wonder if these two heroic leaders were more similar than perhaps anyone would have guessed. Whether read as a companion to <em>Manhunt</em>&#x2014;Swanson&#x2019;s account of the 12-day search for John Wilkes Booth&#x2014;or on its own, <em>Bloody Crimes</em> is the next great Civil War-era read worthy of the recognition that Lincoln once said we should all strive for. --<em>Jessica Schein</em> <p></p> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: James L. Swanson on Writing <em>Bloody Crimes</em></strong> <br> <br> I wrote <em>Bloody Crimes</em> as a way of answering a question many <em>Manhunt</em> readers asked: &#x201c;What happened next?&#x201d; In <em>Manhunt</em> I told just one of the three incredible stories that unfolded at the climax of the Civil War. I could only hint at the strange and amazing things that happened to Lincoln&#x2019;s body after he died, and I could do no more than allude to Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s dramatic flight from Richmond and his six week odyssey to save the Confederacy. So it would be correct to say that <em>Bloody Crimes</em> is a sequel to <em>Manhunt</em>. <p></p> Since I was a child, I&#x2019;ve been fascinated by the Lincoln funeral train, and I debated whether to write a book about that story alone. It is hard for a modern reader to comprehend how much Lincoln&#x2019;s death, the White House funeral, the Pennsylvania Avenue procession, and the president&#x2019;s sojourn home to Illinois influenced America. Imagine the death of President Kennedy and intensify by several degrees the emotions it released. As I researched the Lincoln funeral pageant, I began thinking about another president on his great journey. As I studied Davis, I realized that he is one of the &#x201c;Lost Men&#x201d; of American history. Today we know so little about him. To my great surprise, he and Lincoln had much in common. Some of their shared experiences were stunning, even profound. And in April 1865, both presidents left their White Houses, took to the field, and sought to rally their armies at the climax of the war. <p></p> Combining the final journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis into one book presented several challenges. I needed to return to the assassination, but I did not want to repeat material from <em>Manhunt</em>. I solved that problem by, like a film director, shifting the camera and pointing it in a different direction. In <em>Manhunt</em>, my camera captured every moment of action inside Ford&#x2019;s Theatre. In <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, that camera never sets foot inside Ford&#x2019;s, but instead takes position inside the Petersen House, capturing the assassination through fresh eyes, those of the boarders who lived there and the visitors who descended upon it. In <em>Manhunt</em>, once Lincoln was dead, he ceased to be a principal character in the book. In <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, though Lincoln is dead, he remains a vital character until the end. One of the pleasures of writing the book was meeting the splendid cast of characters who played significant roles in the death pageant, including the larger-than-life Commissioner of Public Buildings in Washington, D.C., Benjamin Brown French, who kept an amazing diary. <p></p> Another great pleasure was experiencing the final journey of Jefferson Davis through the firsthand accounts of his inner circle, cabinet members, young female loyalists, and his family, especially Davis&#x2019;s wife Varina. The love letters they exchanged during his darkest days go unread today, but they are as moving as the correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. <p></p> I cannot write a book without holding in my hand the original sources&#x2014;Civil War newspapers, documents, photos, and artifacts&#x2014;and I must visit the sites where history happened. Through these objects and places, I travel back in time and, I hope, take my readers with me. Many of the places I visited while writing <em>Bloody Crimes</em> still haunt me: The Confederate White House, where toys still lie upon the floor, as if the Davis children will return momentarily to continue their play; the East Room of Lincoln&#x2019;s White House, site of his majestic funeral; the cemetery vault in Georgetown, where Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s dead son Willie waited for his father to claim him and bring him home to Illinois; and the graves of Jefferson Davis and his family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Indeed, shortly before the publication of <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, I visited the grave of Jefferson Davis. A powerful storm had twisted and torn from the ground a mighty oak tree that had, for the past century, offered shade to Davis&#x2019;s grave and bronze statue. Had the massive tree fallen in a slightly different direction, it would have smashed the gravestone and toppled Jefferson Davis from his pedestal. <p></p> The final journeys of Lincoln and Davis, each a martyr to his cause, tell the stories of two men, two peoples, and two nations during the most thrilling days in American history. Their dual stories form an American epic, a kind of American <em>Iliad</em>, that made our history, and that continues to influence it to this day.<br><p>As the Yankees approached Richmond on April 2, 1865, Jefferson Davis fled the capital, setting off an intense and thrilling chase in which Union cavalry hunted the Confederate president. Two weeks later, President Lincoln was assassinated, and the nation was convinced that Davis was involved in the crime. Preparing for the largest and most magnificent funeral pageant in American history, soldiers placed Lincoln&#x2019;s corpse aboard a special train to Springfield, Illinois. Along the way, several million mourners watched the funeral train roll by. </p><p>The saga that began with <em>Manhunt</em> continues as James Swanson masterfully weaves together the stories of the two fallen leaders as they make their final journeys through the bloody landscape of a wounded nation.</p></p><h2>Rescue at Los Ba�os: The Most Daring Prison Camp Raid of World War II</h2><p><p>From the bestselling author of <em>Hero Found</em> comes the incredible true story of one of the greatest military rescues of all time, the 1945 World War II prison camp raid at Los Ba�os in the Philippines&#x2014;a tale of daring, courage, and heroism that joins the ranks of <em>Ghost Soldiers, Unbroken</em>, and <em>The Boys of Pointe du Hoc</em>.</p><p>In February 1945, as the U.S. victory in the Pacific drew nearer, the Japanese army grew desperate, and its soldiers guarding U.S. and Allied POWs more sadistic. Starved, shot and beaten, many of the 2,146 prisoners of the Los Ba�os prison camp in the Philippines&#x2014;most of them American men, women and children&#x2014;would not survive much longer unless rescued soon.</p><p>Deeply concerned about the half-starved and ill-treated prisoners, General Douglas MacArthur assigned to the 11th Airborne Division a dangerous rescue mission deep behind enemy lines that became a deadly race against the clock. The Los Ba�os raid would become one of the greatest triumphs of that war or any war; hailed years later by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell: &#x201c;I doubt that any airborne unit in the world will ever be able to rival the Los Ba�os prison raid. It is the textbook operation for all ages and all armies.&#x201d;</p><p>Combining personal interviews, diaries, correspondence, memoirs, and archival research, <em>Rescue at Los Ba�os</em> tells the story of a remarkable group of prisoners&#x2014;whose courage and fortitude helped them overcome hardship, deprivation, and cruelty&#x2014;and of the young American soldiers and Filipino guerrillas who risked their lives to save them.</p></p><p><p> Rescue at Los Ba�os is the spellbinding survival story of more than two thousand American and Allied civilian prisoners of war&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;held in the Philippines by the Japanese during World War II, and the elite 11th Airborne Division&#x2019;s heart-pounding mission in a race against the clock to rescue them from behind enemy lines</p><p></p><p> As U.S. victory in the Pacific drew near, Japanese soldiers at the Los Ba�os Internment Camp became increasingly sadistic and began systematically starving, beating, and killing their captives. Fearing the loss of more innocent lives, General Douglas MacArthur gave the 11th Airborne Division the dangerous mission of freeing these beleaguered men, women, and children in a deadly race against the clock. Rescue at Los Ba�os deftly weaves together dramatic accounts of the prison camp with detailed analysis of the complex military operation being planned and carried out, documenting the incredible story of the prisoners and those who risked their lives to save them.</p><p></p><p>Bruce Henderson has written more than twenty books, including the national bestseller <em>Hero Found</em> and <em>Rescue at Los Ba�os</em>.

Lachlan, their alpha, his hair going the white of wisdom and age, was saying something to Lucas, who was barely fifteen but carried the scent of a future alpha. The past and the future side by side. One day soon, Lucas would lead them. Everyone knew that. The boy had been drenched in blood, his parents murdered in front of his eyes. But he would lead. It didn&#x2019;t matter that even if they waited a decade, he&#x2019;d still be far too young.</p><p>Just like Tamsyn was too young at nineteen to be the senior healer for the DarkRiver leopard pack. Her mentor had been Lucas&#x2019;s mother, Shayla. The attack on Lucas&#x2019;s family had not only stolen their healer, it had left DarkRiver in a state of constant alert. That didn&#x2019;t mean they had given up. No, they were quietly building their strength until the day they could destroy the ShadowWalkers&#x2014;the pack that had murdered their own.</p><p>She knew Nate would be one of those who went after the rogue pack when the time came. He stood tall and strong beside Lachlan, his concentration on whatever it was they were discussing. At twenty-nine years of age, he was one of the pack&#x2019;s top soldiers and would soon be a sentinel, assuming Cian&#x2019;s position when the older man retired from active duty. The sentinels were the pack&#x2019;s first line of defense. They were the strongest, most intelligent, and most dangerous predators of them all.</p><p>&#x201c;Tammy, you&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, she looked away from Nate and into Lysa&#x2019;s bright green eyes. &#x201c;I only got in an hour ago.&#x201d; Even now, she didn&#x2019;t quite believe she was home&#x2014;the six months she&#x2019;d spent at the teaching hospital in New York had been the hardest of her life.</p><p>&#x201c;So the course is over?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. That part of it anyway.&#x201d; She could finish the rest of her medical training in nearby San Francisco. Most changeling healers relied on their inborn gifts, but Tamsyn had made the decision to study conventional medicine as well. It was one more way to compensate for her inexperience, for the healing gifts that hadn&#x2019;t yet matured to full strength. She refused to allow her youth to disadvantage her pack.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing went wrong while I was away?&#x201d; She&#x2019;d hated leaving DarkRiver in someone else&#x2019;s care, though she fully trusted the healer who&#x2019;d stepped in to hold the fort during her absence. &#x201c;Maria?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She left this morning. Itching to get back home exactly like you.&#x201d; Lysa smiled. &#x201c;It was nice of Maria&#x2019;s pack to lend her to us and she was great, but damn, I&#x2019;m glad to have you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Tamsyn returned her friend&#x2019;s fierce hug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to be back.&#x201d;</p><p>Lysa set her free. &#x201c;Go on. I know you&#x2019;re wanting to catch up with Nate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She glanced over her shoulder. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s busy with Lachlan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The man&#x2019;s your mate, girl. You can drag him away.&#x201d;</p><p>Mate. The word made her heart skip as it had since the day she&#x2019;d turned fifteen. That was when the mating instinct had awakened, when she&#x2019;d realized she was one of the lucky ones&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been born into the same pack as her mate, had known him since childhood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not official yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Lysa rolled her eyes. &#x201c;As if that matters. Everyone knows you two are meant for each other.&#x201d;</p><p>Maybe, but they were nowhere near to consummating the relationship. Nate was determined she get the chance to explore her freedom before settling down. What she had never been able to make him see was that he was her freedom. She didn&#x2019;t want to be apart from him. But Nate was stronger than her. And at ten years her senior, he was used to giving orders and having them followed.</p><p>&#x201c;I should freshen up,&#x201d; she said, dragging her eyes away from him a second time. &#x201c;I just dropped off my bags before coming here.&#x201d; Searching for him.</p><p>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;ll see you after you&#x2019;ve settled in.&#x201d; Lysa smiled. &#x201c;I have to go talk to Lachlan about something.&#x201d;</p><p>Nodding good-bye, Tamsyn began to move away from the large clearing ringed by trees that was the pack&#x2019;s outdoor meeting place.</p><p>� � �</p><p>NATE had seen Tammy arrive, waited for her to come to him. And now she was walking away. &#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said to Lachlan, no longer caring about the discussion at hand. Some Psy named Solias King was apparently making what he thought were discreet inquiries about DarkRiver&#x2019;s territorial reach and ability to defend itself. Lachlan was fairly certain the man wanted to steal their land.</p><p>&#x201c;This is important&#x2014;oh.&#x201d; The DarkRiver alpha looked up and followed the path of Nate&#x2019;s gaze. His frown turned into a grin. &#x201c;No wonder you&#x2019;re distracted. Guess we won&#x2019;t be seeing you for a while. We&#x2019;ll have to track this idiot down ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>Good-natured laughter followed Nate out of the Pack Circle as he tracked his mate&#x2019;s scent through the trees. He caught her in under a minute. The second his palm clasped the back of her neck, she froze. &#x201c;Nathan.&#x201d;</p><p>Her skin was delicate under his hand and he was very aware of how easily he could damage her. With her hair swept up into a long tail, her neck appeared even more vulnerable. He rubbed his thumb over the softness of her. &#x201c;When did you get back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Around four.&#x201d;</p><p>It was now five thirty and winter-dark. &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; The leopard who was his other half didn&#x2019;t like that she hadn&#x2019;t come to him first.</p><p>She turned her head, eyes narrowed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like you left a note as to your whereabouts.&#x201d;</p><p>His beast calmed. She&#x2019;d gone looking for him. Gentling his hold, he slid his hand to the side of her neck and pulled her to him. She came but her body was stiff against his. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Juanita was very happy to tell me where you were.&#x201d;</p><p>He heard the jealousy. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a friend and a fellow soldier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was also your lover.&#x201d;</p><p>The beast wanted to growl. &#x201c;Who told you that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a decade younger than you,&#x201d; she retorted. &#x201c;Of course you&#x2019;ve had women. I don&#x2019;t need anyone to paint me a sign.&#x201d;</p><p>The jagged edge of anger turned his next words razor-sharp. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t taken a lover since your fifteenth birthday.&#x201d; He was a healthy leopard male in his prime. Sexual hunger did not sit well with him. But neither did cheating on his mate. &#x201c;And if someone&#x2019;s telling you different, I&#x2019;ll tear out their throat.&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s telling me different.&#x201d; Her voice was husky. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t like knowing you&#x2019;ve had other women in your bed, that they&#x2019;ve touched you, pleasured you.&#x201d;</p><p>Her bluntness shocked him. Tamsyn did not talk to him like that. &#x201c;What exactly did you do in New York?&#x201d; The possessive fury that hit him was close to feral, a harsh thing with claws and teeth.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe this!&#x201d; Breaking his hold with a quick move of her head&#x2014;a move he&#x2019;d taught her&#x2014;she faced him, hands on her hips. &#x201c;You think I would&#x2014;&#x201d; She gave a little scream. &#x201c;You know what, if I had, whose fault would that be?&#x201d;</p><p>He folded his arms to keep them from hauling her back against his chest and proving to his beast that she still belonged to him. &#x201c;Tamsyn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve had it up to here!&#x201d; She jerked the edge of her hand to below her chin. &#x201c;All the other females my age are taking lovers left, right, and center, and the only thing I get is frustration!&#x201d;</p><p>Her raw need was simple truth. Newly mature females were very sexual, their scent intoxicating to the young males. Then there was the fact that the mating heat had shifted Tammy&#x2019;s natural hunger into higher gear. He could taste the woman musk of her, the lush ripeness just waiting to be bitten into&#x2014;it was an exhilarating blend, and one he alone had the right to crave. Even the idea of any other male lusting after her pushed his temperature into explosive range. &#x201c;If I take you,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;it&#x2019;ll be for life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that! And I accept it. I need to belong to you&#x2014;in every way.&#x201d;</p><p>His cock wanted to take her up on it. But she was nineteen. She didn&#x2019;t understand what it was she was committing to. He wasn&#x2019;t some cub who&#x2019;d follow her around with his tongue hanging out like the young males did with the females. He&#x2019;d take her and he&#x2019;d keep her. Sexually, he was far more mature than she was, and a leopard changeling&#x2019;s sexual needs only grew more intense with time. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re asking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it, Nate, I&#x2019;m sick of needing you so much I can&#x2019;t sleep.&#x201d; Her hands fisted by her sides, caramel-colored eyes rich with heat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sick of stroking myself to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesus. The images that hit him were hot and erotic and so detailed they threatened to drive his beast to madness. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had this discussion before,&#x201d; he reminded her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re carrying too much responsibility as it is.&#x201d; Shayla&#x2019;s murder had forced Tammy to step into the older woman&#x2019;s position&#x2014;as DarkRiver&#x2019;s healer&#x2014;at seventeen years of age. She&#x2019;d never had a chance to be a juvenile, to mess about, to play and roam. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen exactly how wrong things can go if leopards bond before they&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are not your parents,&#x201d; she spit back.</p><p>He went silent. &#x201c;I told you to never bring up my parents again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; She was trembling. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re the reason you&#x2019;re being so stupid. Just because your mother was miserable after deciding to take a permanent partner at age eighteen doesn&#x2019;t mean I will be.&#x201d;</p><p>His mother had been more than miserable. &#x201c;She committed suicide.&#x201d; If not in truth, then in effect. Her drinking had escalated to such an extent that even her tough changeling physiology hadn&#x2019;t been able to repair the damage.</p><p>&#x201c;We are not your parents!&#x201d; Tamsyn repeated, her voice breaking on the last word. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my mate. And I&#x2019;m yours. Your mother and father didn&#x2019;t have that connection.&#x201d;</p><p>No, his parents had fallen in love the old-fashioned way, without being driven by the mating instincts of the leopard. It happened like that sometimes. Though mating wasn&#x2019;t uncommon, not every changeling found his or her true mate, the one with whom they could bond on a level that was almost psychic. &#x201c;Mating will demand more from you than a nonbond relationship ever would,&#x201d; he told her, cognizant of the terrifying animal fury of his hunger for her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you walking into that before you&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re the one who decides if and when I&#x2019;m ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m older and more experienced.&#x201d; She had years to go before she caught up.</p><p>She seemed to be gritting her teeth. &#x201c;Fine! Enjoy yourself in your perfect little world where everything goes according to your plans. Don&#x2019;t blame me if I get sick of waiting for you!&#x201d; She turned and began to stalk through the trees.</p><p>&#x201c;Tamsyn.&#x201d; He used the tone of voice that made even the rowdiest juvenile stop and pay attention.</p><p>She kept walking.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Striding after her, he caught up just in time to see her clothes disintegrate off her body as she shifted into leopard form.</p><p>He froze, stunned as always by the beauty of her. Her pelt was glossy, the dark rosettes defined luxuriantly against the gold. Suddenly, she looked over her shoulder and gave him a look that could only be described as haughty. Her eyes were green-gold, not caramel, in this form, but they were very definitely all female.</p><p>He growled at the implied challenge. She snapped her teeth in response and took off. He almost went after her&#x2014;his claws were already out by the time he brought himself back under control. If he ran her down in his current state...well, she wouldn&#x2019;t be complaining about stroking herself to sleep again.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Now his mind was so full of images of soft feminine flesh and long stroking fingers that he was in danger of bursting out of his pants. &#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; Turning in the opposite direction from her, he ran toward a nearby waterfall. An ice-cold bath was exactly what he needed to knock some sense into his head.</p><p>He wondered if she moaned when she brought herself to orgasm.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>TAMSYN SHIFTED BACK into human form near her parents&#x2019; home. They lived fairly close to the Pack Circle and it was where she was staying for the time being, her life in limbo&#x2014;she should have been living with Nate by now. Eyes stinging at the reminder of his rejection, she went to retrieve some clothes she&#x2019;d hidden for just such contingencies. Nudity was no big deal in the pack, but she was already going to be a crybaby. At least she could be a clothed crybaby.</p><p>Dressed, she walked to the front door. Her mother opened it before she could knock. With her dark hair and pale brown eyes, Sadie Mahaire was an older, smaller version of Tamsyn. It was Tamsyn&#x2019;s father who had given his daughter her height. Her mother took one look at her face and opened her arms. &#x201c;Come here, my darling.&#x201d;</p><p>Sobbing, Tamsyn went into her mother&#x2019;s embrace. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do, Mom,&#x201d; she said, what felt like hours later. She was lying on the sofa, her head in her mother&#x2019;s lap and her legs curled up on the cushions. &#x201c;This need I have for him, it&#x2019;s clawing me to pieces. But...but he doesn&#x2019;t seem to feel the same.&#x201d; That knowledge crushed her, made her feel as if she were bleeding inside.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes he does.&#x201d; Sadie stroked Tamsyn&#x2019;s hair off her face with gentle hands. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s simply had longer to get used to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Longer? How? The bond awakened at the same instant in both of us.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d come to the door on her fifteenth birthday and she&#x2019;d felt something in her snap taut, a connection so strong, it vibrated with how utterly right it was.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but you were fifteen. Your sexuality was young, immature.&#x201d;</p><p>She remembered the wave of heavy warmth that had uncurled in her stomach whenever she&#x2019;d been around Nathan, the soft ache in low places. &#x201c;I wanted him even then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But as a girl wants, not as a woman.&#x201d; Sadie pressed a kiss to her brow. &#x201c;He, on the other hand, had to have had a brutal time of it. You were a baby and he&#x2019;d never have allowed himself to touch you, but he was a man and his beast knew you were his mate.&#x201d;</p><p>Tamsyn began to see what her mother was saying. &#x201c;He had to learn to chain the mating urges of the leopard, wait until I was ready.&#x201d; For the first time, she understood the pain it must&#x2019;ve caused him. &#x201c;And he couldn&#x2019;t be with any other woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mates don&#x2019;t cheat.&#x201d; Sadie sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good thing, but it&#x2019;s also a hard thing to bear when things don&#x2019;t work out perfectly. But you understand about Nate now, don&#x2019;t you? He&#x2019;s as hungry for you as you are for him&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just that he&#x2019;s had years to build up his will against the need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to be a sentinel, Mom,&#x201d; she said, proud but afraid. &#x201c;You know the kind of men who become sentinels. His will was already as strong as steel before he found out about the bond. Now I&#x2019;m pretty certain it&#x2019;s unbreakable.&#x201d; She rubbed a hand over her heart, where the bond was a savagely twisted knot. Though it was meant to be an instinctive link, Nate had somehow learned to block it.

This expanded 25th Anniversary edition includes a new preface by Bernadette Mayer, an editor&#39;s note by Tender Buttons Press publisher Lee Ann Brown, and a selection of previously unpublished archival material including the Skinny Sonnets, described as &#34;Hypnogogic Word Playing in Reporters&#39; Notebooks&#34; which further expand our map of Bernadette Mayer&#39;s ground-breaking works of writing consciousness.</p><p>Bernadette Mayer (born May 12, 1945) is an American poet, writer, and visual artist associated with both the Language poets and the New York School. Mayer&#39;s record-keeping and use of stream-of-consciousness narrative are two trademarks of her writing, though she is also known for her work with form and mythology. In addition to the influence of her textual-visual art and journal-keeping, Mayer&#39;s poetry is widely acknowledged as some of the first to speak accurately and honestly about the experience of motherhood. Mayer edited the journal 0 TO 9 with Vito Acconci, and, until 1983, United Artists books and magazines with Lewis Warsh. Mayer taught at the New School for Social Research, where she earned her degree in 1967, and, during the 1970s, she led a number of workshops at the Poetry Project at St. Mark&#39;s Church in New York. From 1980 to 1984, Mayer served as director of the Poetry Project, and her influence in the contemporary avant-garde is felt widely, with writers like Kathy Acker, Charles Bernstein, John Giorno, and Anne Waldman having sat in on her workshops.</p><h2>The Wehrmacht Retreats: Fighting a Lost War, 1943 (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>Throughout 1943, the German army, heirs to a military tradition that demanded and perfected relentless offensive operations, succumbed to the realities of its own overreach and the demands of twentieth-century industrialized warfare. In his new study, prizewinning author Robert Citino chronicles this weakening Wehrmacht, now fighting desperately on the defensive but still remarkably dangerous and lethal. <br><br>Drawing on his impeccable command of German-language sources, Citino offers fresh, vivid, and detailed treatments of key campaigns during this fateful year: the Allied landings in North Africa, General von Manstein's great counterstroke in front of Kharkov, the German attack at Kasserine Pass, the titanic engagement of tanks and men at Kursk, the Soviet counteroffensives at Orel and Belgorod, and the Allied landings in Sicily and Italy. Through these events, he reveals how a military establishment historically configured for violent aggression reacted when the tables were turned; how German commanders viewed their newest enemy, the U.S. Army, after brutal fighting against the British and Soviets; and why, despite their superiority in materiel and manpower, the Allies were unable to turn 1943 into a much more decisive year. <br><br>Applying the keen operational analysis for which he is so highly regarded, Citino contends that virtually every flawed German decision&#x2014;to defend Tunis, to attack at Kursk and then call off the offensive, to abandon Sicily, to defend Italy high up the boot and then down much closer to the toe&#x2014;had strong supporters among the army's officer corps. He looks at all of these engagements from the perspective of each combatant nation and also establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt the synergistic interplay between the fronts. <br><br>Ultimately, Citino produces a grim portrait of the German officer corps, dispelling the longstanding tendency to blame every bad decision on Hitler. Filled with telling vignettes and sharp portraits and copiously documented, <i>The Wehrmacht Retreats</i> is a dramatic and fast-paced narrative that will engage military historians and general readers alike.</p><p>Robert M. Citino is professor of history at the University of North Texas and author of eight books, including <i>Death of the Wehrmacht: The German Campaigns of 1942; The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years&#x2019; War to the Third Reich; Quest for Decisive Victory: From Stalemate to Blitzkrieg in Europe, 1899&#x2013;1940;</i> and <i>Blitzkrieg to Desert Storm: The Evolution of Operational Warfare,</i> which won both the Society for Military History&#x2019;s Distinguished Book Award and the American Historical Association&#x2019;s Paul Birdsall Prize."Like all of Citinos work, this book brims with perceptive insights and clever observations."<i><b>German Studies Review</b></i><p>"A fine book, well written and relevant to professional military officers and academics alike. Furthermore, it is good history. Citino demonstrates the power of objective analysis to illuminate present challenges through a rigorous study of the past. . . . Even those who consider themselves well read on the topic will find new and interesting nuggets and will have their preconceived notions challenged. Perhaps the greatest merit of this book is the idea that ways of war have a shelf-life."<i><b>Army History</b></i></p><p>"Skilfully performs the dual act of combining impeccable research with a cracking good read. Indeed far from the Wehrmachts lost war being the harbinger of a dry history, Citinos study brings out the great importance of this period by highlighting the drama within the German command as well as the grueling events at the front. . . . In all aspects of his discussion of 1943 Citinos trademark mastery of the vast literature is evident. . . . Like his many past works, <i>The Wehrmacht Retreats</i> deserves to be widely read."<i><b>War in History</b></i></p><p>"Essential reading for anyone interested in the military campaigns of the war. . . . Whether the reader is a serious military historian, a serving soldier, or the casual military history buff, the prose is perfect. Added benefits are excellent photos and maps. . . . Citinos contribution stands as the definitive operational analysis of the Wehrmacht in 1943."<i><b>Army</b></i></p><p>"Like all of Citinos work, this book is fairly brimming with perceptive insights and shrewd observations. . . . The writing is always lively and a good read. <i>The Wehrmacht Retreats</i> is a must for both the serious scholar to even the most casual student of World War II."<i><b>New York Military Affairs Symposium</b></i></p><p>"This splendidly detailed operational history recasts<br><br>1943 as a year of stalemates, and examines how the Wehrmacht managed savage defensive moves despite hemorrhaging in an unwinnable two-front war."<i><b>World War II Magazine</b></i></p><p>"An expert on the German way of war, Citino cites the German military tradition of emphasizing the offensive over defense as being a prime reason for the sapping of the Wehrmachts power in the pivotal year 1943. This is a well-written and very readable work that will interest those looking for more depth in their understanding of the military history of World War II. Recommended for readers with knowledge of World War II or an interest in military history."<i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br>An outstanding book.

An author, farmer and journalist, he yearned for something more than his simple country life could afford, and became intimately familiar with the English language while enlisted with Nova Scotia. Noted for his efforts which served as a preamble to the Reform Bill of 1832, as well as for his aversion to authority and novelty, Mr. Cobbett is most famous for his <i>Rural Rides</i>, which was printed in 1830. He also composed <i>A History of the Protestant Reformation in England and Ireland</i>, which amounts to a thrilling and accurate portrayal of the untold disasters of the times during the Reform. He died on the eighteenth of June, 1835, at the age of seventy-two.<br>G.K. Chesterton says that the accuracy of William Cobbett s History of the Reformation has never been challenged: only his challenge has been challenged!

She has a passion for cooking and works contentedly in a Lebanese restaurant, while her storytelling uncle and her saucy boss, Umm Nadia, believe she should be trying harder to find a husband. One day Hanif, a handsome professor of Arabic literature, an Iraqi exile, comes to the restaurant. Sirine falls in love and finds herself questioning everything she thought she knew about Hanif, as well as her own torn identity as an Arab-American.</p></p><p>It's a positive relief to read a novel that treats Iraqis as real people. Diana Abu-Jaber's second novel, <i>Crescent</i>, is set in Los Angeles and peopled by immigrants and Iraqi-Americans. Thirty-nine-year-old, half-Arab Sirine is a chef in a Lebanese restaurant. Her uncle works at the university with Han, an Iraqi-born academic who begins frequenting Sirine's restaurant, drawn by her beauty and her exquisite cooking. Part of the book's charm is in its determination to impart the sheer glamour of Arabia, here personified in Han's face: "Sirine watches Han and for a moment it seems that she can actually see the ancient traces in Han's face, the quality of his gaze that seems to originate from a thousand-thousand years of watching the horizon--a forlorn, beautiful gazing, rich and more seductive than anything she has ever seen." Too, the book addresses head-on the one-dimensional view Americans possess of Iraq. I used to read about Baghdad in <i>Arabian Nights</i>," says one American character. "It was all about magic and adventurers. I thought that's what it was like there. And when I got older Baghdad turned into the stuff about war and bombs--the place on the TV set. I never thought about there being any kind of normal life there." As she falls more deeply in love with Han, Sirine discovers that part of being Iraqi now means learning to live with not knowing: not knowing where people have disappeared to, not knowing if your family is alive or dead. In the book's thrilling, romantic denouement, these lessons come perilously close to Sirine's Los Angeles home. Crescent brings alive a vibrant community of exiled academics, immigrants on the make, and optimistic souls looking for love. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Diana Abu-Jaber is the award-winning author of four novels, including Crescent, and two memoirs, Life Without a Recipe&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Language of Baklava.

His simple, realistic style of painting captures the old traditions and peaceful rural splendor of Quebec's Laurentian Mountains and Charlevoix region at the end of the 19th century. </p><p> The book traces Gagnon's early life and influences, examining his career as an illustrator and his development as an artist. Included here are excerpts from Gagnon's personal letters, which reveal his astute observations of life, art and politics. </p><p> Liberally illustrated with Gagnon's sublimely executed paintings -- many never before published together in one volume -- Clarence Gagnon is a superb tribute to an international artist who always remained passionate about his simple origins. </p></p><p><p> Anne Newlands worked for twenty-seven years as an educator and researcher-writer at the National Gallery of Canada. She is the author of numerous books including <i>Canadian Paintings, Prints and Drawings</i>, <i>Canadian Art: From Its Beginnings to 2000</i>, <i>Clarence Gagnon: An Introduction to His Life and Art</i>, <i>Emily Carr: An Introduction to Her Life and Art</i>, and <i>The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson: An Introduction</i>. She is currently writing a book about the Quebec textile artist Mariette Rousseau-Vermette (1926-2006). </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> In the 125 years since Clarence Gagnon was born in a little village north of Montreal, the appeal of his peaceful paintings of rural Quebec has endured, conjuring affection for the old traditions and visual splendour of the Laurentians and the Charlevoix region of eastern Quebec. Best known for his images of sun-filled winter landscapes and the colourful illustrations for Louis H�mon's novel, <i>Maria Chapdelaine</i>, Gagnon was also an award-winning printmaker, whose fascination with technical perfection and craftsmanship inspired experiments in printmaking and led him later to mix his own paints. A complex and multi-talented individual, Gagnon's varied interests, skills and passions frequently competed with the time for his art. As a passionate outdoorsman and a bon vivant, he filled his photo albums with images of fishing, skiing, hiking and sailing that all reflected his intense enthusiasm for nature. Despite the many years of living abroad, his love of the picturesque villages and dramatic landscapes of the Charlevoix region fostered his interest in the domestic arts of the habitants. These people were descendants of French peasant farmers, and their geographical isolation perpetuated their adherence to traditions largely untouched by industrialization. Gagnon's friendship with them led to his active promotion of Quebec handicrafts, along with his contribution of designs and colour schemes to improve the quality of local products. "All art is fine art," he wrote, "and no art worthy of the name can lose caste by assisting the other arts." </p><p> His involvement in the 1920s with Eric Brown, Director of the National Gallery of Canada, and his association with some of the Group of Seven artists, enhanced his pride in his French-Canadian identity and reinforced the contributions of fellow Quebec artists to the story of Canadian art. Gagnon's astute observations of the life, art and politics that surrounded him are recorded in his abundant correspondence, giving us insights -- in both English and French -- into his personality and preparing us for the burst of eloquent speeches delivered later in life. Characterized by his friend the poet Duncan Campbell Scott as "an intense and untiring craftsman in whatever he undertook," Gagnon's concentrated "thoroughness" was balanced, as many others have also noted, by a spirit of optimism that similarly illuminated his art. </p></p><h2>The Terrible Year : The Paris Commune, 1871</h2><p>Beneath the glittering facade of Louis-Napoleon&#39;s Second Empire there were forces of seething social and political unrest. When France succumbed to the Prussian invaders these forces came to the surface and the Commune took over. It ruled for only a brief seventy days before it died in a holocaust of fire and bloodshed that was far worse than anything perpetrated during France&#39;s Great Revolution of 1789, but it left behind an indelible mark which spread far beyond the boundaries of France. &#39;A brilliant writer&#39; New York Times Book Review</p><p>Alistair Horne was educated at Le Rosey, Switzerland, and Jesus College, Cambridge. He ended his war service with the rank of Captain in the Coldstream Guards attached to MI5 in the Middle East. From 1952 to 1955 he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. In 1969 he founded the Alistair Horne research fellowship in modern history, St Antony&#39;s, Oxford.

Against Apion (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Josephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97.</p><p>As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: <i>History of the Jewish War</i>, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and <i>Jewish Antiquities</i>, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the works of Josephus also includes the autobiographical <i>Life</i> and his treatise <i>Against Apion</i>.</p></p><p><p>Henry St. John Thackeray (1869&#x2013;1930) was Grinfield Lecturer on the Septuagint at Oxford University.</p></p><h2>History of Virginia Wines, A: From Grapes to Glass (American Palate)</h2><p>Go beyond the bottle and step inside the minds, and vines, of Virginia&#39;s burgeoning wine industry in this groundbreaking volume.

No name, just a telephone number.<br><br>I called that night. A woman answered.<br><br>"Hello, who is it?" She sounded fretful, harried. "Who is calling, please?"<br><br>I said in Yiddish, "A good week."<br><br>There was a slight pause. "Ah, a good week," she said. Her tone softened.<br><br>I said in English, "My name is Davita Dinn. I'm calling about your request for an English tutor."<br><br>In the background I heard children crying. Turning away from the phone, she shouted something in Yiddish, which I did not understand.

I took the easy chair across from them. The woman turned to the boy and spoke to him in Yiddish.<br><br>The boy had been staring at the fireplace. Now he looked at me, cleared his throat, and said something in Yiddish in a shaky voice.<br><br>I said, "I'm sorry, I don't understand Yiddish."<br><br>Sarah Polit said with surprise, "You speak no Yiddish?"<br><br>"My parents raised me in English."<br><br>"Your parents are in America a long time?"<br><br>"My mother came in early 1920.

He had oval features: pallid skin across his cheekbones, a straight nose, a pointed chin. His hair was cut short and black, and his wide dark eyes darted from me to his aunt. I did not know how much of the conversation he understood.<br><br>Sarah Polit asked, "What did you say your name is?"<br><br>"Ilana Davita Dinn."<br><br>"Dinn is your father's name?"<br><br>"No, my stepfather's."<br><br>"What does your stepfather do?"<br><br>"He's an immigration lawyer."<br><br>She looked at my blond hair and blue eyes. "You observe the commandments?"<br><br>Her questions did not surprise me; she wanted to be sure about the kind of home to which she was entrusting the boy.<br><br>I told her that I observed the commandments.<br><br>"And you have taught English to people who have come from Europe?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>She was quiet.<br><br>I turned to the boy. "What's your name?"<br><br>The boy looked at his aunt.<br><br>"Tell her, Noah."<br><br>"I am call Noah Stremin."<br><br>"Where did you hear English?"<br><br>"American soldati after war."<br><br>Sarah Polit was looking closely at my blond hair and blue eyes. She asked, "What was your father? What did he do?"<br><br>"He was a journalist."<br><br>"What was his name?"<br><br>"Michael Chandal."<br><br>"You took your stepfather's name?"<br><br>"He gave me his name when he adopted me."<br><br>Sarah Polit sat back. I had the notion she had decided to ask no more questions. We were a religious family, and she was fortunate to have found us. Most teachers didn't want to work during the summer months; many took their families to bungalows in the country to get them away from the streets.<br><br>I asked, "Where in Europe are you from, Mrs. Polit?"<br><br>"I came in the twenties from a town called Kralov, not far from Cracow."<br><br>"I know about Cracow. About sixty thousand Jews."<br><br>"Well, Kralov had four thousand Jews, a Jewish market, small synagogues and schools, and a wooden synagogue. Both our families were from Kralov."<br><br>He was sitting next to her, looking at the carpet. His face without expression. It was not possible to tell if he understood what she was saying.<br><br>"There was a pogrom in Kralov in the late twenties, and my father sent me here to America. He, my mother, and my two brothers, they stayed. May their memories be for a blessing."<br><br>The boy raised his hands, turned them over, and looked at them. A grimace crossed his face. Putting his hands back on his knees, he sat staring at the fireplace.<br><br>Pronouncing the words with care, I asked him, "Noah, is there anything special you like to do?"<br><br>He raised his head and looked at me blankly.<br><br>"I thought we might start with words for something you enjoy doing."<br><br>Sarah Polit said, "He was three years in a slave labor camp and two years in a displaced persons camp. He just now arrived in America. He does not yet know what he likes."<br><br>"Can he come twice a week?"<br><br>"Twice a week. Yes."<br><br>"Sundays and Wednesdays."<br><br>"What do you charge?"<br><br>"Five dollars a lesson. We can start this Wednesday at three."<br><br>"What should he bring?"<br><br>"A notebook and a pencil."<br><br>"That's all?"<br><br>"For the time being."<br><br>"I thank you."<br><br>She spoke to the boy in Yiddish. He got off the sofa, and I saw him go through the entrance hallway to the front door. As he opened the door he gave me an over-the-shoulder look, and I felt his dark eyes on my face. He closed the door behind him.<br><br>Sarah Polit remained seated on the sofa, looking at the door. Then she turned to me.<br><br>"Noah is the only one who survived."<br><br>"The only one in his family? I am sorry."<br><br>"The only Jew in the town."<br><br>I felt cold to the bone.<br><br>"Four thousand Jews, and he is the only survivor. My husband and I, we say to ourselves God saved him for a reason."<br><br>I sat very still.<br><br>She rose from the sofa. "He knows, of course. He has terrible dreams." She looked around the room. "Tell me, is three o'clock the only time you have?"<br><br>"It's best for me."<br><br>She smoothed her dress. "He will be here on Wednesday, God willing. I thank you very much for your time."<br><br>She went out the door.<br><br>From the window of the living room I watched them walk along the street together in the hot shade of the early summer maple trees.</p><h2>A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E. Lawrence</h2><p><p>When this Pulitzer Prize-winning biography first appeared in 1976, it rescued T. E. Lawrence from the mythologizing that had seemed to be his fate. In it, John Mack humanely and objectively explores the relationship between Lawrence's inner life and his historically significant actions.</p><p>Extensive interviews, far-flung correspondence, access to War Office dispatches and unpublished letters provide the basis for Mack's sensitive investigation of the psychiatric dimensions of Lawrence's personality. In addition, Mack examines the pertinent history, politics, and sociology of the time in order to weigh the real forces with which Lawrence contended and which impinged upon him.</p></p><p>John Mack, M.D., was Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Founding Director of the Center for Psychology and Social Change, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&#x201c;A hugely admired, and Pulitzer prize-winning, biography which concentrates on the relationship between Lawrence's inner life and the actions and events which grew out of them. It is easy to warm to a biographer who, while drawing on his training as a psychiatrist, is never deceived into thinking that theory can 'explain' his Lawrence. The more Mack discovered about the social contexts of Lawrence's actions and the demands on a public man, the more he understood Lawrence's psychology. The result is a resounding confirmation of this approach to his subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Desmond Christy</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;We are not likely to get as thorough and judicious a biography of T.

Featuring a building-by-building breakdown of the most significant sites in Chinatown, the guide is lavishly illustrated with historical and contemporary photographs and offers walking tours for tourists and locals alike.</p><p>"A stunning new guidebook. . . .

He describes the investigations into lives of candidates, explains how claims for miracles are approved or rejected, and reveals the role politics -- papal and secular -- plays in the ultimate decision. From his examination of such controversial candidates as Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador and Edith Stein, a Jewish philosopher who became a nun and was gassed at Auschwitz, to his insights into the changes Pope John Paul II has instituted, Woodward opens the door on a 2,000-year-old tradition.</p><p>Kenneth L. Woodward, a senior writer at <i>Newsweek,</i> has been the magazine's religion editor for thirty-two years. He lives in Westchester County, New York.The Vatican allowed Woodward, a veteran Vatican observer and Newsweek journalist, unprecedented access to the persons and documentation involved in canonization. He traces the evolution of the process through two millennia, concentrating on recent declarations of sainthood and pending cases. He reports on a little-noticed change in 1983 in which a historical-critical review replaced the former adversarial debate between the "Devil's" and the petitioners' advocates. Another change was in the criteria for martyrdom to include victims of Nazism. He ends with an eloquent plea on behalf of Cardinal Newman, whose beatification has made little progress. Intriguing, thoughtful, and intelligently critical.<br><i>- Richard S. Watts, San Bernardino Cty.

In 1998, London's National Theatre selected <i>Angels in America</i> as one of the best plays of the 20th century.The first volume of The Art of Maurice Sendak, published when he was 53, covered the period 1951&#x2013;1981, and spanned more than 80 books, including Sendak&#x2019;s signature, Caldecott-winning book, Where the Wild Things Are. This new collection presents 350 illustrations, many of which are drawings for set and costume design work, which Sendak has been producing prolifically, others of which are posters for plays and for events such as the New York is Book Country fair. The style of all these works will be familiar to fans of Wild Things; Sendak&#x2019;s precise, intensely shaded yet welcoming shapes and figures have lost none of their luster. They would ordinarily be enough in themselves in a survey like this, but Kushner&#x2019;s lovely, funny, partisan text ("I&#x2019;ve been his devoted fan since I was four years old") lifts the book to another level. It&#x2019;s not often that the subject of such as book is matched with a writer as gifted and assured. His discussion of the book&#x2019;s better known gems&#x2014;such as the poster for Really Rosie (the theatre production based on Sendak&#x2019;s book of the same name)&#x2014;as well as his analysis of less celebrated works&#x2014;such as Sendak&#x2019;s Blakean illustrations for an edition of Kleist&#x2019;s Penthesilea&#x2014;help makes this volume a worthy companion to Selma Lane&#x2019;s initial, classic collection. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has made a life out of doing things the hard way. <br> The result is a book that dives headfirst into adventure and experience. Jenkins transports the reader with him as he climbs the ice-encrusted Italian Ridge of the Matterhorn, sea kayaks from battlefield to battlefield along the Turkish coast of Gallipoli, sneaks across Tibet to reach Buddhism's holiest lake, descends unexplored canyons in Australia, and traverses the war-torn Simen Mountains of northern Ethiopia. <br> If you've ever dreamed of escaping, lighting out for the unknown, read this book. In a world increasingly vicarious and secondhand, we all long to make decisions that matter, decisions of consequence. This is precisely what the outdoor life still requires. <i>The Hard Way</i> is a book about doing, not watching -- about leaping before you look.</p><p>Mark Jenkins is a journalist and the author of several health books, including the <i>Sports Medicine Bible</i>, and is a consultant to the Harvard Medical School system.Adult/High School-A collection of nearly two dozen stories, many drawn from Jenkins's column for Outside magazine. The author whisks readers away to places where geography, weather, and the occasional political boundary pose daunting challenges for adventurers who actively seek to test their limits in extreme conditions. Whether the example is crossing a crevasse-ridden glacier in Wyoming, mountain climbing in Tibet, or hiking in a remote Ethiopian nature preserve hoping to spot endangered species, the point is the exultation of pitting oneself against the perils of natural landscapes, mastering the challenge through physical ruggedness and mental tenacity, and emerging alive. Each focused, brisk chapter wraps up cleanly with a neat sentence of observation that often reveals a darker outcome to the episode than the narrative implies. Most of the entries are based on the author's firsthand experiences, decorated with colorful descriptions of like-minded souls with whom he has partnered on various expeditions. A few tales, such as the profile of mountaineer George Mallory, smoothly complement, but do not keep to, this pattern. A cameo of Jenkins introducing his daughters at ages three and six to rock climbing in order to develop their confidence and sense of self-reliance brings an added dimension to the collection. Although Jenkins says that preparedness, conditioning, and avoiding ego-based lapses of judgment are essential to a venture's safe outcome, be aware that the spirited energy that infuses his anecdotes nevertheless leans toward celebration of reckless acts.<br><i>Lynn Nutwell, Fairfax City Regional Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Model-Making: Materials and Methods</h2><p><p>Models can be used in a wide variety of situations, including theater production, architecture design, animation, and set design.

His massive compendium, characterized by his wit, his elegance, his bursts of satire alternating with serious views, was among the most learned and widely circulated of Renaissance books. This selection emphasizes Erasmus' skill in explaining the proverbs, shows how he made his book, and demonstrates the way in which many of the proverbs moved into the English language. The text is illustrated with images by Brueghel and D�rer and examples of proverb use from emblem books.</p><p>Over eighty proverb essays are presented here. Some are masterpieces of social criticism ('War is sweet to those who have never tried it'), others provide scholarly explanations of philosophical ideas or gestures and customs ('Thumbs up'). Many of the proverbs have passed into modern usage ('Know thyself' , To give someone the finger' 'Well begun is half done'), some even retaining their Latin form ('Deus ex machina'). And a few, it turns out, were created by Erasmus himself through his occasional misinterpretation of the ancient languages ('Pandora's box', 'To call a spade a spade').</p><p>This edition replaces the pioneering work by Margaret Mann Phillips, providing more essays and more detailed source and background information for the texts. It is based on the translations and scholarship of the Collected Works of Erasmus - mostly that of Sir Roger Mynors but also the work of Phillips herself.</p></p><p><b>William Barker</b> is a professor in the Department of English at Dalhousie University and the former president and vice-chancellor of University of King&#x2019;s College.<br></p><h2>Execution Dock: A William Monk Novel</h2><p>On the bustling docks along the River Thames, Great Britain&#x2019;s merchant ships unload the treasures of the world.

Then, at the last moment, when the other lighter was almost past him, he crouched and sprang. He only just reached the deck, scrambling to secure his footing. He swayed for a moment, then regained his balance and turned. He waved once in grotesque jubilation, then dropped to his knees out of sight behind the close-packed bales of wool. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk smiled grimly as the oarsmen strained to bring the police boat around against the outgoing tide and the wash from barges on their way up to the Pool of London. He would not have given orders to shoot, even were he certain of not hitting anyone else in the teeming river traffic. He wanted Jericho Phillips alive, so he could see him tried and hanged. &nbsp; <br><br>In the prow of the boat, Orme swore under his breath. He was a grizzled man in his late fifties, a decade older than the lean and elegant Monk, who had been in the Thames River Police Force only half a year. It was very different from the force ashore, where his experience lay, but more difficult for him was taking over the leadership of men to whom he was an outsider. He had a reputation for brilliance in detection, but also for a nature ruthless and hard to know, or to like. &nbsp;<br><br> Monk had changed since then. The accident eight years ago in 1856, which had wiped out his memory, had also given him a chance to begin again. He had learned to know himself through the eyes of others, and it had been bitterly enlightening. Not that he could explain that to anyone else.<br><br> &nbsp; They were gaining on the lighter, where Phillips was crouching out of sight, ignored by the man at the helm. Another hundred feet and they would draw level. There were five of them in the police boat. That was more than usual, but a man like Phillips might require the extra strength to take him down. He was wanted for the murder of a boy of thirteen or fourteen, Walter Figgis, known as Fig. He was thin and undersized, which might have been what had kept him alive so long. Phillips's trade was in boys from the age of four or five up to the time when their voices changed and they began to assume some of the physical characteristics of adults, and they were thus of no use in his particular market of pornography. &nbsp; <br><br>The police boat's bow sliced through the choppy water. Fifty yards away a pleasure boat went lazily upstream, perhaps eventually towards Kew Gardens. Colored streamers blew in the wind, and there was the sound of laughter mixed with music. Ahead of them nearly a hundred ships from coal barges to tea clippers were anchored in the Upper Pool. Lighters plied back and forth, and stevedores unloaded cargoes brought in from every corner of the earth. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk leaned forward a little, drawing in breath to urge the oarsmen to even greater effort, then changed his mind. It would look as if he did not trust them to do their best anyway. But they could not possibly want to catch Phillips as much as he did. It was Monk, not they, who had involved Durban in the Louvain case that had eventually cost him his life. And it was Monk whom Durban had recommended to take his place when he knew he was dying. &nbsp; <br><br>Orme had served with Durban for years, but if he resented Monk's command he had never once shown it. He was loyal, diligent, even helpful, but for the most part, impossible to read. However, the longer Monk watched him, the more he realized Orme's respect was necessary to his success, and more than that, he actually wanted it. The thought jarred inside him. He could not remember ever before having cared what a junior thought of him. &nbsp; <br><br>The lighter was only twenty feet ahead of them now and slowing as it made way for another lighter crossing its bow, which was laden with casks of raw sugar from a schooner moored fifty yards away. The ship was riding high now with its load almost gone, its huge canvases furled, spars bare and circling gently as it rocked. &nbsp; <br><br>The police boat plunged forward and to port as the other lighter crossed to starboard. The first man leapt aboard, then the second, pistols drawn. &nbsp; <br><br>Phillips was the one case Durban had not closed, and it had remained, even in his last notes, a still-bleeding wound in his mind. Monk had read every page since he had inherited them from Durban, along with the job. The facts were there, dates, times, people questioned, answers, conclusions, resolutions as to what to pursue next. But through all the words, the letters, sprawled and jagged, burned the emotion. There was an anger far deeper than the mere frustration of failure, or the injured pride at being outwitted. There was a deep, scalding fury at the suffering of children, and a pity for all the victims of Phillips's trade. And whether Monk wanted it to or not, it scarred him too. He thought about it when the day was ended and he was at home. It invaded the peace of mealtimes. It intruded into his conversations with his wife, Hester. Very little else had ever done that. &nbsp; <br><br>He sat rigid in the stern of the boat now, aching to join the men on the lighter. Where were they? Why had they not reappeared with Phillips? &nbsp; <br><br>Then he understood-they were on the wrong side. Phillips had judged it exactly. Knowing they would have to pass to port to avoid ramming the other lighter, he had gone to starboard and jumped again. It was risky, but he had nothing to lose. When they caught him he would be tried, and there could be only one verdict. Three Sundays later, he would be hanged. &nbsp; <br><br>"Get the men back!" he shouted, half rising from the seat. "He's gone to starboard! On the other lighter!" &nbsp; <br><br>They must have realized it too. Orme took the other oar, unshipped it, and began to pull hard to bring the boat astern of the first lighter. &nbsp; <br><br>The two men returned, leaping down, sending the boat rocking violently. This was no time to change places with Orme. The other lighter was already twenty yards away and heading towards the dock. If Phillips made it before they caught him he would disappear among the boxes and bales, the tea chests, rum and sugar casks, the piles of timber, horn, hides, and pottery that crowded the quayside. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk's body was rigid, the wind blowing in his face sharp with the smells of salt and fish on the outgoing tide. Catching Phillips was the one thing he could still do for Durban. It would justify the trust Durban had placed in him after knowing him only a few weeks. They had shared nothing of daily life and routine, only one case of a horror almost beyond imagination. &nbsp; <br><br>The lighter ahead passed out of sight for a few moments, hidden by the stern of a five-masted schooner. Monk watched intently. It seemed to take far too long to reappear. Was Phillips catching a loose rope, calling out for help from the stevedores, anything to board the ship? If so, Monk would have to go back to the station at Wapping and get more men. Anything could happen in that time. &nbsp;<br><br> Orme must have seen the possibility too. He hurled his weight behind his oar, shouting at the other men. The boat leapt forward and the lighter appeared again, still comfortably ahead of them. Monk swiveled to stare at the hull of the schooner, but there was no one on the ropes over its sides. The stevedores on the deck were still bent-backed, hauling casks up out of the hold. &nbsp; <br><br>Relief swept over Monk as they closed on the lighter. Another minute or two and they would have Phillips. The long chase would be over. With him in custody it would only be a matter of waiting for the law to take its course. &nbsp; <br><br>The police boat came alongside the lighter. Again two armed men boarded, and came back moments later, bleak-faced and shaking their heads. This time Monk swore. Phillips had not gone up the sides onto the schooner, he was certain of that. No matter how agile, a man could not climb the ropes swiftly enough in the few minutes he had been out of sight. No lighter had passed them going to the north bank. It could only have been to the south. &nbsp; <br><br>Angry, rowing with tight-knotted shoulders, the men sent the boat straight around the stern of the schooner into the wash of a stream of barges going upriver. They bucked and veered, slapping hard down into the water and sending up spray. Monk clung on to the sides, snarling between his teeth as he saw another lighter going south to Rotherhithe. &nbsp;<br><br> Orme saw it at the same moment, and gave the order. &nbsp; <br><br>They wove through the traffic. A ferry crossed swiftly in front of them, passengers crouched against the wind; a pleasure boat sent snatches of music into the air. This time the lighter made it to the dockside only twenty yards ahead of them, and they saw Phillips's agile figure, hair and coattails flying, jump from the stern as they passed the East Lane Stairs. He landed on the lowest step, which was slimed over from the tide. He teetered for a moment, arms wheeling, and then fell sideways, hard against the stone wall green with weed. It must have hurt, but he knew the police boat was not far behind him, and fear must have spurred him to scramble to his hands and knees and clamber upwards. It was a maneuver utterly without dignity, and a couple of lightermen jeered at him, but it was extremely rapid. By the time the police boat jarred against the stone, Phillips was at the top on the dry surface. He sprinted towards the Fore and Aft Dock with its crates of pottery from Spain, dumped haphazardly amid dark brown barrels and lighter piles of unfinished timber. The stench of hides was thick in the air, mixed with the sickening sweetness of raw sugar and the heady aroma of spices. Beyond that was the Bermondsey Road, and a whole network of streets and alleys, doss-houses, pawnshops, chandleries, taverns, and brothels. &nbsp;<br><br>Monk hesitated only a moment, fearing wrenched ankles, the howls of laughter from the dockers and lightermen if he actually fell into the river, and how idiotic he would feel if Phillips escaped because his own men had had to stop to fish him out. There was no time for such weighing and judging. He stood up, felt the boat pitch sideways, and launched himself towards the steps. &nbsp; <br><br>He landed awkwardly. His hands hit stone and weed, but his one goal kept him going. He slipped on to one knee, cracking it hard on the ledge of the next rise. Pain shot through him, but no numbness to prevent him from straightening up and climbing behind Phillips, almost as if he had meant to land as he did. &nbsp;<br><br> He reached the top of the steps and saw Phillips thirty feet ahead, running towards a stack of dark, wooden barrels and the winch beyond it. The lumpers unloading more from a lighter below took no notice at all. Some of them were bare-chested in the sun, skin glistening with sweat. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk ran across the open space. Then he hesitated when he reached the barrels, knowing Phillips could be just behind them, at best with a length of wood or pipe, at worst a blade. Instead he swung around and went along the length of the stack and around the farther side. &nbsp; <br><br>Phillips must have counted on exactly that. He was climbing the long barrier of a pile of bales, going up it as an able seaman might climb a spar, hand over hand, easily. He looked back once, his mouth pulled wide in a sneer, then heaved himself over the top and stopped just for an instant before dropping down the far side. &nbsp; Monk had no choice but to follow, or lose him. Phillips might leave his wretched boat, find some hovel on the bank for a while, then reappear in half a year, and in the meantime God knew how many more boys would suffer, or even be killed. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk shinned awkwardly up the bales, more slowly than Phillips, and reached the top with relief. He crawled over to the far edge and looked down. It was a long drop, perhaps fifteen feet. Phillips was in the distance, making for more mounds of cargo, casks of wine, cases of spice or tobacco. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk was not going to risk the jump. A broken ankle would lose him Phillips altogether. Instead he lowered himself, clung for a moment by his hands, then let go and fell the rest of the way. He turned and sprinted, reaching the casks of wine just as Phillips bolted across an open patch of stone towards the shadowed overhang of a cargo ship moored close up to the wharf. Its ropes were trailing, a crane beside her, a load of timber being lowered as they watched. &nbsp; <br><br>A horse-drawn wagon moved closer, wheels rumbling on the uneven stone. A gang of lumpers was walking towards the crane. A couple of idlers argued over what looked like a piece of paper. Everywhere there was noise: men shouting, the cry of gulls, the clang of chains, the creak of wood, the constant slap of river water against the stone. There was the incessant movement of the sun reflected on the water, sharp and glittering. The huge moored ships rose and fell. Men in grays and browns toiled at a score of tasks. Smells filled the air: river mud thick and sour, the harsh cleanness of salt, the sickly sweetness of raw sugar, the stench of hides and fish and ships' bilges, and, a few yards ahead, the bewitching perfume of spices. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk took a chance. Phillips wouldn't try for the ship; he would be too exposed as he went up the side, like a black fly on a brown wall. He would head the other way, and disappear into the alleys. &nbsp;<br><br> Or would he bluff? Double bluff? &nbsp; <br><br>Orme was on Monk's heels. &nbsp; <br><br>Monk headed towards the alley entrance between the warehouses. Orme drew in a breath, and then followed him. The third policeman stayed on the quayside. He had done this sort of thing often enough to know men could double back. He would be waiting. &nbsp; <br><br>The alley, which was no more than six feet wide, went down steps, then twisted one way, then the other. The stink of urine was sharp in Monk's nose. There was a chandler's shop to the right, its narrow doorway surrounded by coils of rope, ships' lanterns, wooden cleats, and a bucket full of hard-bristle brushes. &nbsp;</p><h2>John Updike: Collected Early Stories (LOA #242) (Library of America John Updike Edition)</h2><p>The Library of America presents the first of two volumes in its definitive Updike collection.

For much of that time the Troubles (1968&#x2013;1998) dominated life in Ireland's second-biggest population centre, and during the darkest days of the conflict--in the 1970s and 1980s--riots, bombings, and indiscriminate shootings were tragically commonplace. The British army patrolled the streets in armoured vehicles and civilians were searched for guns and explosives before they were allowed entry into the shopping district of the city centre...Belfast is still a city divided...<br><br>You can see Belfast's bloodstains up close and personal. This is the city that gave the world its worst ever maritime disaster, and turned it into a tourist attraction; similarly, we are perversely proud of our thousands of murders, our wounds constantly on display. You want noir? How about a painting the size of a house, a portrait of a man known to have murdered at least a dozen human beings in cold blood? Or a similar house-sized gable painting of a zombie marching across a postapocalyptic wasteland with an AK-47 over the legend <i>UVF: Prepared for Peace--Ready for War</i>.

He lives with his wife, author Gloria Jean, in Westchester County, NY.Grade 2 Up Recent retellings of Joel Chandler Harris' African-American folktales from former slaves have pruned the dialect and leave out Uncle Remus all together. Most notable of these is Jump!: the Adventures of Brer Rabbit (HBJ, 1986). This newest attempt brings together two distinguished children's book creators in a most unusual recreation. Lester has retold 48 of the folktales in standard English but with a strong feel for the dialect of the original stories. His retellings are as lively as the originals but they also have a liveliness of their own, as he incorporates modern allusions which never seem out of place. Even more importantly, he uses the sharp, witty Uncle Remus who narrated the original folktales, and not the more servile character from the opening and closing segments who many found offensive. Pinkney's illustrations are mostly black-and-white sketches with some full-color double-page spreads. They do not have the sass of the original A. B. Frost illustrations, but they are filled with strong interest and a great humor which serves the text well. This will be of great interest to school and public libraries as well as to storytellers as a source which gives new life to an American classic.

Available to anyone searching to help others in pain.</p><p>Janet Macrae, Ph.D., R.N., has taught more than two hundred Therapeutic Touch workshops in nursing schools and healing centers in the United States. She was head nurse of a pediatric unit at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City from 1973 to 1975, and from 1982 to 1987 was an adjunct assistant professor in the Division of Nursing at New York University. Since 1981 she has had a private practice in Therapeutic Touch in New York City.This is a clear and concise introduction to therapeutic touch, a healing art based on the ancient practice of lying on hands. Although still considered experimental, therapeutic touch is used in many hospitals alongside more conventional medicine to alleviate a variety of injuries and illnesses. Macrae, who taught nursing at New York University, gives a balanced presentation of theory and practice. The theory is based on the concept of an energy field surrounding the bodymuch as a gravitational field surrounds objects. When a person is ill, the flow of energy around his body is congested or obstructed. A trained practitioner can feel these blockages and use his hands to help clear them and to redirect the patient's energy flow to a more healthy pattern.

His<i> Think and Grow Rich</i> is the all-time bestseller in its field, having sold millions of copies worldwide, and setting the standard for today's motivational thinking.Chapter One<br><br> Definiteness of Purpose<br><br> Through the lessons of this book you will be provided with usable knowledge that would cost you a huge fortune if you acquired it, as it was originally organized, from the minds of Andrew Carnegie and more than five hundred other distinguished leaders in American business and industry. Among the persons whose successful experience is published here are Henry Ford, Thomas A. Edison, Stuart Austin Wier, Cyrus H. K. Curtis, Edward Bok, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, Dr. Elmer R. Gates, John Wanamaker, James J. Hill, Edwin C. Barnes, William Howard Taft, Charles M. Schwab, Theodore Roosevelt, Elbert H. Gary, Charles P. Steinmetz, and Woodrow Wilson.<br><br> For all practical purposes you may assume that you are now entering a classroom in which your teachers will consist of more than five hundred of the men who have made America the "richest and freest" country known to civilization. Moreover, you will be privileged to acquire in this book the same knowledge that would have required over ten years of intense study had you procured it from its original source.<br><br> Through this book you will be schooled in an entire philosophy of success, complete and adequate in every respect for the needs of any person seeking the privilege of self-determination under the great American system of personal advancement. You will receive instruction that is not available at any price nor under any circumstances through any other source.<br><br> These lessons have been presented in a manner best suited to enable you to assimilate the knowledge they convey, with no effort on your part beyond a sincere desire to avail yourself of the secrets of achievement which are known to have been the foundation of almost all of the successful business leaders this country has produced.<br><br> In thus departing from the usual academic style of presenting knowledge, the author has kept in mind the fact that this book is for men and women in all walks of life, whose educational background, occupation, and family responsibilities make it necessary for them to acquire practical knowledge by the shortest and quickest method available. The author has had in mind, too, the fact that this book is intended as a "family" schooling and should therefore be presented in an easy, readable style that will be interesting to young men and young women who have not yet finished high school or college as well as to the adult members of the family. Every principle of individual achievement here presented has been tested and tried in the great crucible of practical experience.<br><br> You can read these lessons in a few hours, but more than thirty years of careful research made it possible for you to do this. Moreover, this research was carried on by practical business men who acquired their experience by the trial and error method, over a long period of years.<br><br> Read slowly and digest that which you read, as you go along. The most important part is not in these lessons but in your mind. The major purpose of this chapter is not that of suggesting to you what your definite goal in life should be but rather to bring to your attention the necessity of your choosing a major objective as a starting point toward individual achievement.<br><br> Mark the paragraphs which impress you most as you read and come back to these for a more detailed analysis when time permits. It will be helpful if two or more people form a study club for the purpose of reading and analyzing the lessons together. The benefits of this plan will become more obvious after you finish the lesson on the Master Mind in the next chapter.<br><br> Somewhere in this book, you will find yourself-that "other self," which will throw off all the chains of limitation that previously bound you and reveal to you a veritable giant of power asleep in your brain, needing only some outside force to awaken it. You will find this awakening force. It will come in the form of an idea that you will pick up as you read and think.<br><br> To begin with, there are 17 major principles of success and every person who attains the objective of his major goal, in any undertaking, must use some combination of these principles. I shall name first, the most important. It stands at the head of the list of the 17 principles of achievement because no one has ever been known to succeed without applying it. You may call it the principle of Definiteness of Purpose. Study any person who is known to be a permanent success and you will find that he has a Definite Major Goal; he has a plan for the attainment of this goal; he devotes the major portion of his thoughts and his efforts to the attainment of this purpose.<br><br> Everyone wishes for the better things of life, such as money, a good position, fame, and recognition; but most people never go far beyond the "wishing" stage. Men who know exactly what they want of life and are determined to get it do not stop with wishing. They intensify their wishes into a Burning Desire, and back that desire with continuous effort based on a sound plan.<br><br> The first step from poverty to riches is the most difficult.<br><br> All riches and all material things that anyone acquires through self-effort begin in the form of a clear, concise mental picture of the thing one seeks. When that picture grows, or has been forced to the proportions of an obsession, it is taken over by the sub-conscious mind through some hidden law of nature. From that point on one is drawn, attracted, or guided in the direction of the physical equivalent of the mental picture. I shall come back to this subject of the subconscious mind many times before we finish, as it is one of the vital factors in connection with all outstanding achievements.<br><br> It has long been a mystery to some people why men with little or no schooling often succeed, while men with extensive schooling often fail. Look carefully and you will discover that great successes are the result of understanding and the use of a positive mental attitude through which nature aids men in converting their aims and purposes into their physical and financial equivalent. Mental attitude is the quality of mind which gives power to one's thoughts and plans.<br><br> The length of time which it takes for one's mental attitude to begin attracting the physical and financial requisites of one's major purpose depends entirely upon the nature and extent of one's desires and the control one exercises over his mind in keeping it free from fear and doubt and self-imposed limitations. This sort of control comes through constant vigilance, wherein one keeps his mind free of all negative thoughts and leaves it open for the influx and the guidance of Infinite Intelligence. Definiteness of purpose involving a hundred dollars, for example, might be translated into its financial equivalent in a few days, or even a few hours, or a few minutes, whereas, desire for a million dollars might call for considerably more time, depending to some extent on what one had to give in return for the million dollars.<br><br> The best way to describe the time necessary for the translation of a definite purpose into its physical or financial equivalent can be accurately stated by determining the exact time necessary to deliver the service, or the equivalent in value one intends to give in return for the object of that purpose.<br><br> Before I finish describing the most important principles of achievement, I hope to be able to prove to you that there is a definite connection between giving and getting. Generally speaking, riches and material things that men get are the effect of some form of useful service they have rendered.<br><br> The only known way of insuring that a definite purpose will be carried out to a full realization, through the forces of natural law working through the minds of men, is by first establishing a cause for such realization, through useful service, rendered in a spirit of harmony.<br><br> A well-disciplined mind is capable of holding and acting upon a definite major purpose without any form of outside, or artificial aid. The undisciplined mind needs a crutch to lean upon while dealing with a definite major purpose. The best method to be followed, by one with an undisciplined mind, is that of writing down a complete description of one's major purpose and then adopting the habit of reading it aloud at least once every day. The act of writing down one's major purposes forces one to be specific as to its nature. The act of habitual reading fixes the nature of the purpose in the mind, where it can be picked up by the sub-conscious mind and acted upon.<br><br> The good there is in money consists of the use to which it is put and not in the mere possession of it. Generally speaking, the man who earns his own money acquires, along with it some of the necessary wisdom as to its constructive use.<br><br> If you want a practical illustration of this reasoning, look at what happens to the boy or girl who is brought up by rich parents and is made to feel from early childhood that individual effort in the accumulation of riches is unnecessary. I have never known of a single instance in which a boy brought up in this fashion came within sight of the business acumen and achievements of his father. The real joy of having money comes from earning it; not from receiving it as a gift.<br><br> We have more opportunities in America for the making of fortunes in return for useful service than in all other countries combined. This is a new country. Our resources have only been tapped. Every day brings on new endeavors to open hundreds of new roads of opportunity: Today it's the automobile and the aeroplane-industries in their infancy. Their development opens fields for thousands of young men with imagination, skill, and initiative.<br><br> Our only lack of opportunities is going to be a shortage of imagination, self-reliance and initiative which will be needed to man the future of this country. The whole world is turning to America for new ideas, new inventions, new opportunities for skill and imagination. Look around you everywhere and you will see that this is but the budding age of stupendous opportunity on every hand.<br><br> In the field of Life Insurance there will be great opportunities for men and women to render useful service and make themselves financially independent. The institution of Life Insurance is rapidly becoming the major medium for the development of the habit of saving for millions of our people. The Life Insurance agent of the future will become a teacher as well as a salesman; he will teach people to budget their time and their expenditures by systematic investment in insurance. Keep your eyes on this field, because it represents one of the major pillars of our great American economic system. It will give profitable employment to hundreds of thousands of men and women whose services to the people will be no less useful than the services of the clergymen, or the school teachers. The selling of Life Insurance will become one of the most recognized professions that will pay as well as or better than most of the learned professions. The sale of Life Insurance will be reduced to a science, and eventually it will be taught in the colleges.<br><br> A man's achievements correspond with unerring certainty to the philosophy with which he relates himself to others. If you follow through your willingness to give something in return for the knowledge you desire, you are certain to make yourself so useful to the world that it will be compelled to reward you in terms of your own choice. This is the spirit of true Americanism.<br><br> Every person who seeks personal success in America should both understand and respect the fundamentals of Americanism. Those who neglect or refuse to give loyal support to the institutions of Americanism may unconsciously contribute to the downfall of these supporting pillars, thereby cutting the very foundation from under their own opportunities for personal achievement. It is obvious that no individual may enjoy permanent success if he is out of step with the forces which have given him his opportunity to succeed.<br><br> The Six Pillars of Americanism<br><br> You can best describe Americanism by analyzing the six major pillars which distinguish this country from all others, viz.:<br><br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our American form of Government, as it was originally written into the Constitution of the United States, providing the fullest possible measure of right to individual liberty, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, and above all, freedom of individual initiative that gives to every citizen the privilege of choosing his own occupation and setting his own price upon his knowledge, skill, and experience. No other country in the world offers its citizens such an abundant choice of opportunities for the marketing of his services as those provided under our form of government.<br><br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our Industrial System, with its matchless natural resources of leadership and raw materials, coordinated, as it is, with our American spirit of Democracy, and supported by our American form of Government through which it is protected in every manner possible from the competition of other countries. So long as there is harmony and understanding and sympathetic cooperation between leaders of industry and the officials of our government, every citizen will benefit, directly or indirectly, by our expanding industrial system. If the time ever comes when the leaders of the government and the leaders of industry neglect or refuse to work in harmony toward a common end, the weight of their short-sightedness will fall heavily on the economic life of every citizen. This is definitely becoming an industrial nation. Industry not only supplies a major portion of the income for men who work for wages, but it absorbs a major portion of the products of agriculture, and it is the major source of support for lawyers, doctors, dentists, engineers, educators, churches and others engaged in professional work. There is no way of separating "Americanism" from industry without destroying one of the strongest and most important of the six pillars.<br><br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our Banking System, providing, as it does, the life-blood which keeps our industrial system and our agriculture and our business and professional systems active and flexible at a cost that is not a burden to anyone. Understand the nature of the service being rendered by our banking system and you will be forever done with the ignorant few who cry out against the imaginary sins of "Wall Street." Every well-informed person knows that in this country we have a twin-system of government, with a political division operating in Washington and a financial division operating in New York. When these two branches of our form of national life operate harmoniously, we have prosperous times. Moreover, we have the resources of both political and financial economy to compete successfully with any other country in the world. When these two branches of our national life become antagonistic, as they have done from time to time in the past, we are cursed with "panics" and other ills that damage every citizen. The Banking Houses are just as essential to the successful operation of our system of living as are the merchandising stores and business offices. As a matter of fact, no form of merchandising or business could be carried on successfully without access to a ready supply of cash or credit, which the banks supply.</p><h2>The Courier (7)</h2><p><b>The international bestselling godfather of Nordic Noir takes on one of the most horrific periods of modern history, in a stunning standalone thriller ...

The blackout blind rolls up with a bang. But the room is no lighter. It is still grey outside, neither night nor day. An October morning. She swings her legs out of bed. Sits for a while, staring vacantly into the air before getting up, collecting her clothes from the armchair and going into the kitchen.<br> �se is sitting at the table, breastfeeding.<br> &#x2018;Sleep well?&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Not really, no. I didn&#x2019;t sleep a wink all night.&#x2019; Ester goes to the sink and fills a glass of water from the tap. She puts down the glass and stares at the wall. Not wanting to express her worst thoughts: that she stopped on the way, that she might have arrived at Kirkeristen earlier, that things would be different if she didn&#x2019;t keep making mistakes. But then she feels �se&#x2019;s eyes on her. &#x2018;What is it?&#x2019; Ester asks.<br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;re completely out of it. Didn&#x2019;t you hear?&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Hear what?&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;I said I&#x2019;ve heated some ersatz coffee.&#x2019;<br> Ester smiles, but is not interested. &#x2018;You know, I was never very fond of proper coffee either.&#x2019;<br> She can see her father&#x2019;s eyes through the bars in the iron door; this image has haunted her all night.<br> �se passes her a jug. It contains hot water. Ester takes the jug back to her room and fills the bowl in the corner. Looks at herself in the narrow mirror perched on the dressing table against the wall. She warms her hands in the hot water, splashes a little over her face and wishes she had her toothbrush with her. Lost in thought again, she manages to drag herself away and put on woollen stockings, a skirt, a blouse and a jumper.<br> When they are sitting either side of the table afterwards, she says ying awake and thinking has in fact been useful.<br> �se is sympathetic. &#x2018;What do you think they&#x2019;ll do?&#x2019;<br> Ester is at a loss to know what to say. This is not something she wants to talk about.<br> &#x2018;To your father.&#x2019;<br> Ester doesn&#x2019;t wish to speculate. She has been wondering about it all night. Perhaps it will boil down to a charge connected with his business; perhaps they questioned him for a few hours, then let him go. These thoughts went through her mind, but with little conviction, because the sign on the window told a different story. Eviction from his home, the closing down of the shop. What hap pened the day before was a further turn of the screw. Ester cannot convince herself it will be the last.<br> �se squeezes her hand.<br> They exchange looks.<br> Ester says that now, for her, there is only one solution. &#x2018;I have to get to Sweden. As soon as possible.&#x2019;<br> �se places Turid over her shoulder to burp her. Pats her little back gently. No burp. She stands up and swings round, but the child shakes her head; she&#x2019;s not in tune with her mother&#x2019;s plan.<br> &#x2018;Are you sure?&#x2019;<br> Ester has never been surer of anything. &#x2018;They say we don&#x2019;t own our possessions. My father&#x2019;s driven off in a police van, and they barred the doors of the shop with iron chains. It&#x2019;s only a question of time before they come for me.&#x2019;<br> �se is silent.<br> They look at each other again, and Ester doesn&#x2019;t know what to say to lighten the atmosphere.<br> &#x2018;But how will you get to Sweden?&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;The people I talked about, in Carl Berners plass. But I need money. Clothes. I have to go home and pack. Dad doesn&#x2019;t need his money now.&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;What if&#x2014;?&#x2019; Ester interrupts her. &#x2018;I have to do this!&#x2019;<br> She can hear how harsh and irritated her voice is. But she has had<br> enough of talking now, and gets up and goes into the hallway. Finds her shoes. Slips her feet in. Goes out to the stairwell. The toilet is free. She enters, fastens the hook on the door and leans against it. Some things can be said. Not everything, though. When Ester is overcome by despair, like now, she stands and waits for it to pass. The walls in the little room appear to be pulsating. She sits down on the seat. What happened the previous day is a link in a longer chain that started years before. What she has to do today is react while she still can. She has to defy them, she has to go home and pack, get ready for the journey.<br> Ester glances at her watch. Sees that she has to hurry.<br> She leaves the toilet and goes back to the flat, into the kitchen. Washes her hands in the sink, then takes the suitcase containing the newspapers.<br> &#x2018;Are you sure you want to do that today, Ester?&#x2019;<br> �se has put Turid down.<br> &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t not do it. Someone&#x2019;s waiting for me.&#x2019; Ester gives her friend a hug. It turns into a long embrace.<br> �se swallows. &#x2018;Will I see you before you go?&#x2019;<br> They look at each other, and Ester senses that she has to be honest.<br> &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2019;<br> Neither of them speaks. �se&#x2019;s eyes are moist and shiny.<br> Ester picks up the suitcase. &#x2018;In a way it&#x2019;s wonderful too, knowing this is the last time. I&#x2019;m afraid I have to go.&#x2019;<br> Then she is out of the door.</p></p><h2>Not Quite a Husband (The Marsdens)</h2><p>Sherry Thomas is one of the hottest new voices in historical romance, garnering the highest praise from today&#x2019;s bestselling writers (&#x201c;Entrancing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mary Balogh; &#x201c;Ravishingly sinful, intelligent and addictive.&#x201d; &#x2014;Eloisa James).

She enjoys creating stories. And when she is not writing, she thinks about the zen and zaniness of her profession, plays computer games with her sons, and reads as many fabulous books as she can find.<i>Chapter One<br>**<br></i><br><br>Rumbur Valley<br>Chitral Agency<br>North-West Frontier of India<br>Summer 1897<br><br>In the bright afternoon sun, the white streak was a gash of barrenness against the deep rich black of her hair. It started at the edge of her forehead, just to the right of center, swept straight down the back of her head, and twisted through her chignon in a striking&#x2014;and eerie&#x2014;arabesque.<br><br>It invoked an odd reaction in him. Not pity; he would no more pity her than he would pity the lone Himalayan wolf. And not affection; she'd put an end to that with her frigidity, in heart and body. An echo of some sort then, memories of old hopes from more innocent days.<br><br>In a white shirtwaist and a dark blue skirt, she sat between two fishing rods set ten feet apart, a bucket by her side, a twig in her hand, tracing random patterns in the swift-flowing, aquamarine water.<br><br>Across the stream, fields glinted a thick, bright gold in the narrow alluvial plain&#x2014;winter wheat ready for harvest. Small, rectangular houses of wood and stacked stone piled one on top of another along the rising slope, like a collection of weathered playing blocks. Beyond the village, the ground elevated more rapidly, a brief stratum of walnut and apricot trees before the bones of the hills revealed themselves, austere crags that supported only dots of shrubs and an intrepid deodar or two.<br><br>"Bryony," he said. His head hurt, but he must speak to her.<br><br>She went still. The twig washed downstream, caught in a rock, then spun and floated free again. Still facing the stream, she wrapped her arms about her knees. "Mr. Marsden, how unexpected. What brings you to this part of the world?"<br><br>"Your father is ill. Your sister sent several cables to Leh, and when she received no response from you, she asked me to find you."<br><br>"What's the matter with my father?"<br><br>"I don't know the specifics. Callista only said that the doctors are not hopeful and that he wishes to see you."<br><br>She rose and turned around at last.<br><br>At first glance, her face gave the impression of great tranquillity and sweetness. Then one noticed the bleakness behind her green eyes, as if she were a nun on the verge of losing her faith. When she spoke, however, all illusions of meek melancholy fled, for she had the most leave-me-be voice he'd ever heard, not strident but stridently self-sufficient, and little concerned with anything that did not involve diseased flesh.<br><br>But she was silent this moment and reminded him of a churchyard stone angel that watched over the departed with a gentle, steady compassion.<br><br>"You believe Callista?" she asked, destroying the semblance.<br><br>"I shouldn't?"<br><br>"Unless you were dying in the autumn of ninety-five."<br><br>"I beg your pardon?"<br><br>"She claimed you were. She said you were somewhere in the wastes of America, dying, and desperately wanted to see me one last time."<br><br>"I see," he said. "Does she make a habit of it?"<br><br>"Are you engaged to be married?"<br><br>"No." Though he should be. He knew a number of beautiful, affectionate young women, any one of whom would make him a suitable spouse.<br><br>"According to her you are. And would gladly jilt the poor girl if I but give the command." She did not look at him as she said this last, her eyes on the ground. "I'm sorry that she dragged you into her schemes. And I'm much obliged to you for coming out this far&#x2014;"<br><br>"But you'd rather I turned around and went back right away?"<br><br>Silence. "No, of course not. You'll need to rest and reprovision."<br><br>"And if I didn't need to rest or reprovision?"<br><br>She did not answer, but turned away from him. Then she bent down, retrieved a fishing rod, and reeled in something that was struggling to escape.<br><br>Weeks upon weeks of trekking across some of the most inhospitable terrains on Earth, sleeping on cold, hard ground, eating what he could shoot and the occasional handful of wild berries so he wouldn't be weighed down by a train of coolies carrying the usual necessities deemed indispensable for a sahib's travels&#x2014;and this was her response.<br><br>One should never expect anything else from her.<br><br>"Even the boy who cried wolf was right about the wolf once," he said. "Your father is sixty-three years old. Is it so unlikely for a man of his age to ail?"<br><br>With a deft turn of her wrist, she unhooked the fish and dropped it into the bucket. "It is a six-week journey to England, on the off chance that Callista might be telling the truth."<br><br>"And if she is, you will regret not having gone."<br><br>"I'm not so certain about that."<br><br>Her ambivalence toward most of Creation had once fascinated him. He'd thought her complicated and extraordinary. But no, she was merely cold and unfeeling.<br><br>"The journey need not take six weeks," he said. "It can be done in four."<br><br>She looked back at him, her expression unyielding. "No, thank you."<br><br>It was 370 miles from Gilgit, where he'd been peacefully minding his own business, to Leh, that much again back to Gilgit, then 220 miles from Gilgit to Chitral. For most of the way he'd done three marches a day, sometimes four. He'd lost a full stone in weight. And he hadn't been this tired since Greenland.<br><br>Fuck you.<br><br>"Very well then." He bowed slightly. "I bid you a good day, madam."<br><br>*<br><br>"Wait," she said&#x2014;and hesitated.<br><br>He turned around halfway.<br><br>When she'd fallen in love with him, he'd been that magical man-child, with the beauty of a dark-haired Adonis and the playfulness of a young Dionysus. She couldn't think of anyone else who'd have gotten away with that song about a cold-blooded duchess and her very hot teapot, which had a three-inch spout that could nevertheless "fill all the right cups, be they shallow or deep, and then to patiently, lovingly steep."<br><br>Toward the end of their marriage, he'd already lost some of that deceptively cherubic sweetness to his looks. Now his profile had become angular and precipitous, like the bleak heights that concealed the Kalash Valleys.<br><br>"Are you leaving now?" she asked. She was conflicted about it, but it would be churlish to not at least offer him tea.<br><br>"No. I have promised to take tea with your friends, Mr. and Mrs. Braeburn."<br><br>"You met them already?"<br><br>"They were the ones who directed me to you," he answered, his tone matter-of-fact, but with an edge of impatience.<br><br>Suddenly she was alarmed. "And what did you tell them about us?"<br><br>Surely he would not have given the Braeburns an account of their short, infelicitous history.<br><br>"I didn't tell them anything. I showed them a photograph of you and asked if I might be able to find you here."<br><br>She blinked. He had a photograph of her? "What photograph?"<br><br>He reached inside his jacket, pulled out a squarish envelope, and held it out toward her. Beyond weariness, his expression gave away nothing. After a moment of wavering she wiped her hands with a handkerchief, walked to him, and took the envelope from his hand.<br><br>She opened the unsealed flap of the envelope and pulled out the photograph. Her retinas immediately burned. It was her wedding photograph. Their wedding photograph.<br><br>"Where did you get this?"<br><br>He'd moved out of their house in Belgravia the day after she'd asked for an annulment, leaving behind his copy of their wedding photograph on his nightstand, which she'd fed to the grate along with her copy.<br><br>"Charlie gave it to me when I passed through Delhi." Charles Marsden was Leo's second eldest brother, formerly political officer at Gilgit, another forward station on the Indian frontier, currently personal aide to Lord Elgin, Viceroy and Governor-General of India. "I suppose he didn't get the hint when I didn't take it with me, because he sent it again by post."<br><br>"What did the Braeburns say after you showed them the photograph?"<br><br>"That I'd find you fishing upstream by the water mill."<br><br>"Did they&#x2014;did they recognize you?"<br><br>"I believe they did," he said coolly.<br><br>Surely, none of this was real. The man who had once been her husband was not standing before her, smelling of horse and road dust and speaking with a voice scratchy with fatigue. He did not mean for her to travel with him. And he had not exposed her as a sham to the kind and decent Braeburns.<br><br>"And what will you tell them now, when you sit down to tea?"<br><br>He smiled, not a very nice smile. "That will depend entirely on you. Were we to start our journey immediately after tea, I would compose a lovely tale of forced separation, heart-wrenching mutual longing, and a joyful reunion here in this most inaccessible of locales. Otherwise, I'll tell them we are divorced."<br><br>"We are not divorced."<br><br>"Let's not split hairs. It was a divorce in everything but name."<br><br>"They will not believe you."<br><br>"And they will believe you who, until a quarter hour ago, was a widow?"<br><br>She took a deep breath and turned her head. "It cannot be helped. To me, you no longer exist."<br><br>From time to time she would be at the most incidental activity&#x2014;lacing her boots or reading an article on the adhesion of the intestine to the stump after an ovariotomy&#x2014;and a physical memory would barrel out of nowhere and mow her down like a runaway carriage.<br><br>The boutonniere he'd worn the evening he first kissed her, a single stephanotis blossom, pure white, as tiny and lovely as a snowflake.<br><br>The sensation of raindrops on warm wool as she placed her hand on his sleeve&#x2014;he'd come personally to the curb to see her into her carriage&#x2014;and the wonderful stillness of her world as he said, smiling, through the still-open carriage door, "Well, why not? It should be no hardship to be married to you."<br><br>The almost prismatic glint of sunlight on the fob of his enameled watch&#x2014;which she'd given to him as an engagement present. He held it suspended in midair, staring at its pendulum swing, while she asked for his cooperation in obtaining an annulment.<br><br>But mostly those upsurges of memory were nothing but ghost pains, nervous misfires from limbs that had been long since amputated.<br><br>To me, you no longer exist.<br><br>He moved as if in recoil. As if he flinched. When he spoke, however, his voice was wholly serene. "Divorced it is then."<br><i><br> Chapter Two</i><br>Mr. and Mrs. Braeburn were originally from Edinburgh. Mr. Braeburn was a Presbyterian minister and an avid scholar of the lands and peoples between the frontier of Russia and the frontier of India. Mrs. Braeburn said, laughing, that she'd married Mr. Braeburn thinking she'd be arranging flowers for the church and taking soup to sick parishioners, only to spend most of their married life tramping all over the Himalayas. For the past ten months they'd lived in Rumbur Valley, studying the cosmology of the Kalasha, the last unconverted people of the Hindu Kush&#x2014;an island of paganism in a sea of Islam.<br><br>Because the stacked stone Kalasha house the Braeburns occupied was not much larger than a postbox, tea was held alfresco. The Commander, the Braeburns' small Portuguese cook, had managed to make a fresh cake in the time since Leo's arrival. With eggs, Mrs. Braeburn informed him, smuggled in two days before from the nearest Muslim village, since the Kalasha's religion frowned upon both chicken and eggs in the diet.<br><br>Leo managed a grin at this account of The Commander's ingenuity. Mrs. Braeburn returned a nervous smile. She was waiting, Leo realized, for Bryony to join them. And then The Questions would finally be asked.<br><br>When Bryony did appear, conversation stopped. She carried the fishing rods in her right hand, the bucket in her left. She'd fished often when she was fifteen, spending the whole day by herself, with a basket of sandwiches and a canteen. His eleven-year-old self used to watch her from the opposite bank of the stream, wishing he knew what to say to the silent, intense girl from the neighboring estate.<br><br>To me, you no longer exist.<br><br>To her, he'd never existed, except those few wonderful weeks before their wedding that distant spring of 1893.<br><br>He watched her wend her way past women in vibrantly embroidered black robes guiding water into the irrigation canals that supplied the fields of wheat, women in vibrantly embroidered black robes shaking ripe mulberries from trees onto blankets, women in vibrantly embroidered black robes cutting hay to make winter fodder.<br><br>Mrs. Braeburn said something about the Kalasha men being away at summer high pasture. Leo nodded, barely registering her words. Bryony handed the bucket and the fishing rods to The Commander, who was chopping carrots on the veranda of the house, with a soft "Only one, I'm afraid." And then she approached the table at last.<br><br>He rose. His joints ached with the movement&#x2014;all the traveling had taken its toll on him. The fever that had ragged at him since he set out from Chitral in the morning was beginning to subside, the chills largely gone, but his headache still lingered. He wished he'd thought to take some more phenacetin in Ayun.<br><br>"Mrs. Marsden," he murmured as he pulled out her chair.<br><br>The corners of her lips tightened. She glanced at him, then at the Braeburns, as if trying to gauge how much truth had been irreversibly spilled.<br><br>"Oh good, now we are all here," said Mrs. Braeburn, her cheer rather overbright.<br><br>She poured tea for Bryony, who accepted the teacup, but set it down in the same motion. "Do you still have your special whiskey, Mr. Braeburn?"<br><br>Mr. Braeburn cleared his throat. "Why, yes."<br><br>"Would you mind serving us a few drops of it?"<br><br>So whatever she'd decided needed the help of strong liquor.<br><br>"Of course not," said Mr. Braeburn, somewhat puzzled. "I was going to serve it at dinner, but I suppose now is as good a time as any."<br><br>He gestured at The Commander. The Commander ducked into the house and promptly returned with a bottle of whiskey and four small glasses.<br><br>Mr. Braeburn poured. "What shall we drink to?"<br><br>"To fond memories," said Bryony, raising her glass. "Mr. Marsden and I are leaving as soon as my belongings can be packed. I wish to take this moment to thank you both for your excellent and admirable friendship."<br><br>"So soon?" gasped Mrs. Braeburn. "But why?"<br><br>Bryony gave Leo a hard stare. "Mr. Marsden can tell it far better than I."<br><br>Across the table she sat rigidly, as tightly wound as the mainspring of a newly cranked clock. He still remembered a time when the tension she carried within her had been unbearably erotic to him, when he'd believed that all she needed was some proper lovemaking to turn her limp, relaxed, and happy.<br>Life had its way of beating humbleness into a man.</p><h2>Maroon Comix: Origins and Destinies</h2><p>Escaping slavery in the Americas, maroons made miracles in the mountains, summoned new societies in the swamps, and forged new freedoms in the forests. They didn't just escape and steal from plantations&#x2014;they also planted and harvested polycultures. They not only fought slavery but proved its opposite, and for generations they defended it, with blood and brilliance. <i>Maroon Comix</i> is a fire on the mountain where maroon words and images meet to tell stories of escape and homecoming, exile and belonging. These stories, tales of the damned who consecrate their own salvation, converge on the summits of the human spirit, where the most dreadful degradation is overcome by the most daring dignity. <i>Maroon Comix</i> is an invitation to never go back, to join hands and hearts across space and time with the maroons and the mountains that await their return.</p><p><b>Quincy Saul</b> is the author of <i>Truth and Dare: A Comic Book Curriculum for the End and the Beginning of the World</i>, and the coeditor of <i>Maroon the Implacable</i>.

In the early period, pagan beliefs and practices were absorbed into everyday culture, including the rituals of the Church. The rise of the practice of "white magic" in the twelfth century became so popular that it caused a widespread determination in the Church to condemn any unsanctioned beliefs or practices. The Church and state, both centralized powers in a decentralized Europe, gradually sharpened their attitude toward magic in general, and sorcery and witchcraft in particular, paving the way for the violent outbreaks of witch persecutions in early modern Europe.</p><p><i>Witchcraft and Magic in Europe</i> combines the traditional approaches of political, legal, and social historians with a critical synthesis of cultural anthropology, historical psychology, and gender studies. The series, complete in six volumes, provides a modern, scholarly survey of the supernatural beliefs of Europeans from ancient times to the present day. Each volume of this ambitious six-volume series contains the work of distinguished scholars chosen for their expertise in a particular era or region.</p></p><p>Bengt Ankarloo is Professor of History at Lund University, Sweden.

On the contrary, the castas, Cope shows, were neither passive nor ruled by feelings of racial inferiority; indeed, they often modified or even rejected elite racial ideology. Castas also sought ways to manipulate their social &#34;superiors&#34; through astute use of the legal system. Cope shows that social control by the Spaniards rested less on institutions than on patron-client networks linking individual patricians and plebeians, which enabled the elite class to co-opt the more successful castas. The book concludes with themost thorough account yet published of the Mexico City riot of 1692. This account illuminates both the shortcomings and strengths of the patron-client system. Spurred by a corn shortage and subsequent famine, a plebeian mob laid waste much of the central city. Cope demonstrates that the political situation was not substantially altered, however; the patronage system continued to control employment and plebeians were largely left to bargain and adapt, as before. A revealing look at the economic lives of the urban poor in the colonial era, The Limits of Racial Domination examines a period in which critical social changes were occurring. The book should interest historians and ethnohistorians alike.</p><p>in this distinguished contribution to Latin American colonial history, Cope draws upon a wide variety of sources to challenge the traditional view of castas as rootless, alienated, and dominated by a desire to improve their racial status.

Since the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo formalized the conquest of half of Mexico's territory into what is now the U.S. Southwest, Chicanos have fought to claim what was promised them in the Treaty&#x2014;the enjoyment of all the rights of U.S. citizens. In terms of education, they certainly have never had equal access, opportunity, or resources, despite legal victories. In this volume, some of the leading scholars analyze why the quest for equality in education has remained so elusive. They do so by documenting both the plight and the struggle of Chicano communities over the past 150 years, using the guiding themes of the role of language, segregation, Americanization, and resistance in the history of education for Chicanos/Chicanas.<br><br> "In the cover painting of this book, Manuel Hernandez Trujillo captures...the dualistic nature of the U.S. conquest of Northern Mexico, reflecting both the losses and opportunities represented in his camino de espinas (road of thorns). This tension between cynicism and optimism pervades the essays in this volume...something I see over and over again in discussions that focus on the significance of race in a democratic society. To what extent does the past determine our future, and to what degree do our own expectations of the future influence our interpretations of the past?

She begins by stating the importance of incorporating it into a healthy diet, the difference between annual and perennial varieties, and various ways to consume them (fresh, juices, sauces). The author provides details about how fruits grow: on plants, bushes, trees, and vines. Each section contains an informative, eye-catching heading; succinctly presented text; and delightful, cheery watercolor illustrations. Gibbons depicts examples of fruits that grow on different kinds of vegetation (for instance, pineapple plants, cherry trees), provides labeled cutaways of their parts, and describes how they are harvested. Readers learn the differences between wild and cultivated berries and what parts of various fruits are planted to produce more. The text also briefly covers large industrial farms and small fruit growers, fruit processing and transportation, and the fresh produce available in stores and farm stands. Kids will learn some surprising facts (for instance, olives are fruits), and a trivia section at the end may encourage further research. Stoke children's enthusiasm by pairing this useful overview with April Pulley Sayre's rousing Go, Go Grapes!: A Fruit Chant (S. &amp; S., 2012).

It is the first battle in which enemy fleets never came within sight of one another. Instead, aircraft launched from carrier decks were sent out to attack the enemy with bombs and torpedoes. </p><p>In May of 1942, the Japanese fleet moved on Port Moresby, the last Allied base between Australia and Japan. Forced to respond, the Americans sent two aircraft carriers to protect the base. In the ensuing battle, one American carrier was destroyed and the other severely damaged. However, the Japanese also lost a carrier and decided to withdraw. Although bloody, it proved to be an important strategic victory for the Allies as the Japanese were forced to attempt future attacks on Port Moresby over land. Using the latest research and numerous period photographs, retired USN Commander Mark O. Stille tells the story of this important and unique battle in the Pacific War.</p></p><p>Commander (retired) Mark O. Stille served as a career Naval Intelligence Officer, spending over five years of his naval career assigned to various US Navy carriers. He continues to work in this field in a civilian capacity. He holds an MA from the Naval War College and has had several wargames published. He lives in Virginia, USA. The author lives in Dunn Loring, Virginia.<p>&#x201c;Though many of you have heard of the Coral Sea battle, this book tells the story in a most enlightening and interesting way.

We are given very informative biographies of the senior Naval Commanders in question, and also a glimpse into the respective Naval ethos of each country. As a former Naval Officer, Stille is well placed to write about Naval tactics and strategy. And of course, this book contains Osprey's trademark maps and illustrations. One thing that really impresses me is the '3D' maps, showing the height of waves of aircraft as the attacked.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daly History Blog, dalyhistory.wordpress.com (December 2009)</i></p><p>&#x201c;As a reviewer, I read a lot of books. Some are good and some less so. Over time, however, I have come to realize that I can always rely on Osprey Publishing to deliver excellent, concise studies of very specific aspects of World War II that are both very well researched and entirely engaging. So it was with a great deal of happy anticipation that I attended a five hour track meet today accompanied only by a cooler of diet cola and Mark Stille's&nbsp;The Coral Sea 1942: The First Carrier Battle.&nbsp;I was not disappointed.<br>Stille presents America's first strategic victory in a thorough and well-organized fashion. He sets the stage by exploring the condition and constitution of the American and Japanese fleets in the Pacific during the months leading up to the MAy 1942 battle and he explores the personalities of the various commanding officers of the combatants. After providing ample background, Stille takes his readers through the actual battle and the aftermath of the battle, noting the connection between the American success (or more accurately, perhaps, the Japanese failures) in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the later success of the American carrier force in the Battle of Midway.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Mitchell, World War II Forums, ww2f.com (November 2009)</i></p></p><h2>Treason at Lisson Grove: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel</h2><p><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br>&nbsp;<br>The man who lies bleeding to death in a London brickyard is no ordinary drifter but a secret informant with details of an international plot against the British government. Special Branch officer Thomas Pitt, hastening to rendezvous with him, arrives seconds after the knife-wielding assassin&#x2014;who, in turn, flees on an erratic course that leads Pitt in wild pursuit to picturesque St. Malo on the French coast.

Pitt turned on his heel just in time to see a figure dart between the rear end of a hansom and the oncoming horses of a brewer&#x2019;s dray. Gower disappeared after him, missing a trampling by no more than inches. <br> <br>Pitt plunged into the street, swerving to avoid a brougham and stopping abruptly to let another hansom pass. By the time he reached the far pavement Gower was twenty yards ahead and Pitt could make out only his flying hair. The man he was pursuing was out of sight. Weaving between clerks in pinstripes, leisurely strollers, and the occasional early woman shopper with her long skirts getting in the way, Pitt closed the gap until he was less than a dozen yards behind Gower. He caught a glimpse of the man ahead: bright ginger hair and a green jacket. Then he was gone, and Gower turned, his right hand raised for a moment in signal, before disappearing into an alley. <br> <br>Pitt followed after him into the shadows, his eyes taking a moment or two to adjust. The alley was long and narrow, bending in a dogleg a hundred yards beyond. The gloom was caused by the overhanging eaves and the water-soaked darkness of the brick, long streams of grime running down from the broken guttering. People were huddled in doorways; others made their way slowly, limping, or staggering beneath heavy bolts of cloth, barrels, and bulging sacks. <br> <br>Gower was still ahead, seeming to find his way with ease. Pitt veered around a fat woman with a tray of matches to sell, and tried to catch up. Gower was at least ten years younger, even if his legs were not quite so long, and he was more used to this kind of thing. But it was Pitt&#x2019;s experience in the Metropolitan Police before he joined Special Branch that had led them to finding West, the man they were now chasing. <br> <br>Pitt bumped into an old woman and apologized before regaining his stride. They were around the dogleg now, and he could see West&#x2019;s ginger head making for the opening into the wide thoroughfare forty yards away. Pitt knew that they must catch him before he was swallowed up in the crowds. <br> <br>Gower was almost there. He reached out an arm to grab at West, but just then West ducked sideways and Gower tripped, hurtling into the wall and momentarily winding himself. He bent over double, gasping to catch his breath. <br> <br>Pitt lengthened his stride and reached West just as he dived out into the High Street, barged his way through a knot of people, and disappeared. <br> <br>Pitt went after him and a moment later saw the light on his bright hair almost at the next crossroads. He increased his pace, bumping and banging people. He had to catch him. West had information that could be vital. After all, the tide of unrest was rising fast all over Europe, and becoming more violent. Many people, in the name of re- form, were actually trying to overthrow government altogether and create an anarchy in which they imagined there would be some kind of equality of justice. Some were content with blood-soaked oratory; others preferred dynamite, or even bullets. <br> <br>Special Branch knew of a current plot, but not yet the leaders be- hind it, or&#x2014;more urgently&#x2014;the target of their violence. West was to provide that, at risk of his own life&#x2014;if his betrayal were known. <br> <br>Where the devil was Gower? Pitt swiveled around once to see if he could spot him. He was nowhere visible in the sea of bobbing heads, bowler hats, caps, and bonnets. There was no time to look longer. Surely he wasn&#x2019;t still in the alley? What was wrong with the man? He was not much more than thirty. Had he been more than just knocked off balance? Was he injured? <br> <br>West was up ahead, seizing a break in the traffic to cross back to the other side again. Three hansoms came past almost nose-to-tail. A cart and four clattered in the opposite direction. Pitt fumed on the edge of the curb. To go out into the roadway now would only get him killed. <br> <br>A horse-drawn omnibus passed, then two heavily loaded wagons. More carts and a dray went in the other direction. Pitt had lost sight of West, and Gower had vanished into the air. <br> <br>There was a brief holdup in traffic and Pitt raced across the road. Weaving in and out of the way of frustrated drivers, he only just missed being caught by a long, curling carriage whip. Someone yelled at him and he took no notice. He reached the opposite side and caught sight of West for an instant as he swung around a corner and made for another alley. <br> <br>Pitt raced after him, but when he got there West had disappeared. &#x201c;Did you see a man with ginger hair?&#x201d; Pitt demanded of a peddler <br> <br>with a tray of sandwiches. &#x201c;Where did he go?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Want a sandwich?&#x201d; the man asked with eyes wide. &#x201c;Very good. Made this morning. Only tuppence.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt fished frantically in his pocket; found string, sealing wax, a pocketknife, a handkerchief, and several coins. He gave the man a threepenny bit and took a sandwich. It felt soft and fresh, although right now he didn&#x2019;t care. &#x201c;Which way?&#x201d; he said harshly. <br> <br>&#x201c;That way.&#x201d; The man pointed into the deeper shadows of the alley. <br> <br>Pitt began to run again, weaving a path through the piles of rubbish. A rat skittered from under his feet, and he all but fell over a drunken figure lying half out of a doorway. Somebody swung a punch at him; he lurched to one side, losing his balance for a moment, glimpsing West still ahead of him. Now West disappeared again and Pitt had no idea which way he had gone. He tried one blind courtyard and alley after another. It seemed like endless, wasted moments before Gower joined him from one of the side alleyways. <br> <br>&#x201c;Pitt!&#x201d; Gower clutched at his arm. &#x201c;This way! Quickly.&#x201d; His fingers dug deep into Pitt&#x2019;s flesh, making him gasp with the sudden pain. <br> <br>Together they ran forward, Pitt along the broken pavement be- side the dark walls, Gower in the gutter, his boots sending up a spray of filthy water. Pace for pace, they went around the corner into the open entrance to a brickyard and saw a man crouching over some- thing on the ground. <br> <br>Gower let out a cry of fury and darted forward, half crossing in front of Pitt and tripping him up in his eagerness. They both fell heavily. Pitt was on his feet in time to see the crouched figure swing around for an instant, then scramble up and run as if for his life. <br> <br>&#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; Gower said, aghast, now also on his feet. &#x201c;After him! I know who it is!&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt stared at the heap on the ground: West&#x2019;s green jacket and bright hair. Blood streamed from his throat, staining his chest and al- ready pooling dark on the stones underneath him. There was no way he could possibly be alive. <br> <br>Gower was already pursuing the assassin. Pitt raced after him and this time his long strides caught up before they reached the road. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; he demanded, almost choking on his own breath. <br> <br>&#x201c;Wrexham!&#x201d; Gower hissed back. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been watching him for weeks.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt knew the man, but only by name. There was a momentary break in the stream of vehicles. They darted across the road to go after Wrexham, who thank heaven was an easy figure to see. He was taller than average, and&#x2014;despite the good weather&#x2014;he was wearing a long, pale-colored scarf that swung in the air as he twisted and turned. It flashed through Pitt&#x2019;s mind that it might be a weapon; it would not be hard to strangle a man with it. <br> <br>They were on a crowded footpath now, and Wrexham dropped his pace. He almost sauntered, walking easily, swiftly, with loping strides, but perfectly casual. Could he be arrogant enough to imagine he had lost them so quickly? He certainly knew they had seen him, because he had swiveled around at Gower&#x2019;s cry, and then run as if for his life. <br> <br>They were now walking at a steady pace, eastward toward Stepney and Limehouse. Soon the crowds would thin as they left the broader streets behind. <br> <br>&#x201c;If he goes into an alley, be careful,&#x201d; Pitt warned, now beside Gower, as if they were two tradesmen bound on a common errand. &#x201c;He has a knife. He&#x2019;s too comfortable. He must know we&#x2019;re behind him.&#x201d; <br> <br>Gower glanced at him sideways, his eyes wide for an instant. &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;ll try and pick us off?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;We practically saw him cut West&#x2019;s throat,&#x201d; Pitt replied, matching Gower stride for stride. &#x201c;If we get him he&#x2019;ll hang. He must know that.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I reckon he&#x2019;ll duck and hide suddenly, when he thinks we&#x2019;re taking it easy,&#x201d; Gower answered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better stay fairly close to him. Lose sight of him for a moment and he&#x2019;ll be gone for good.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt agreed with a nod, and they closed the distance to Wrexham, who was still strolling ahead of them. Never once did he turn or look back. <br> <br>Pitt found it chilling that a man could slit another&#x2019;s throat and see him bleed to death, then a few moments after walk through a crowd with outward unconcern, as if he were just one more pedestrian about some trivial daily business. What passion or inhumanity drove him? In the way he moved, the fluidity&#x2014;almost grace&#x2014;of his stride, Pitt could not detect even fear, let alone the conscience of a brutal murderer. <br> <br>Wrexham wove in and out of the thinning crowd. Twice they lost sight of him. <br> <br>&#x201c;That way!&#x201d; Gower gasped, waving his right hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go left.&#x201d; He swerved around a window cleaner with a bucket of water, almost knocking the man over. <br> <br>Pitt went the other way, into the north end of an alley. The sudden shadows momentarily made him blink, half blind. He saw movement and charged forward, but it was only a beggar shuffling out of a doorway. He swore under his breath and sprinted back to the street just in time to see Gower swiveling around frantically, searching for him. <br> <br>&#x201c;That way!&#x201d; Gower called urgently and set off, leaving Pitt behind. <br> <br>The second time it was Pitt who saw him first, and Gower who had to catch up. Wrexham had crossed the road just in front of a brewer&#x2019;s dray and was out of sight by the time Pitt and Gower were able to follow. It took them more than ten minutes to close on him without drawing attention. There were fewer people about, and two men running would have been highly noticeable. With fifty yards&#x2019; distance between them, Wrexham could have outrun them too easily. <br> <br>They were in Commercial Road East, now, in Stepney. If Wrexham did not turn they would be in Limehouse, perhaps the West India Dock Road. If they went that far they could lose him among the tangle of wharves with cranes, bales of goods, warehouses, and dock laborers. If he went down to one of the ferries he could be out of sight between the ships at anchor before they could find another ferry to follow him. <br> <br>Ahead of them, as if he had seen them, Wrexham increased his pace, his long legs striding out, his jacket scarf flying. <br> <br>Pitt felt a flicker of nervousness. His muscles were aching, his feet sore despite his excellent boots&#x2014;his one concession to sartorial taste. Even well-cut jackets never looked right on him because he weighted the pockets with too many pieces of rubbish he thought he might need. His ties never managed to stay straight; perhaps he knotted them too tightly, or too loosely. But his boots were beautiful and immaculately cared for. Even though most of his work was of the mind, out-thinking, out-guessing, remembering, and seeing significance where others didn&#x2019;t, he still knew the importance of a policeman&#x2019;s feet. Some habits do not die. Before he had been forced out of the Metropolitan Police and Victor Narraway had taken him into Special Branch, he had walked enough miles to know the price of inattention to physical stamina, and to boots. <br> <br>Suddenly Wrexham ran across the narrow road and disappeared down Gun Lane.<br>"He's going for the Limwhouse Station!" Gower shouted, leaping out of the way of a cart full of timber as he dashed after him. <br> <br>Pitt was on his heels. The Limehouse Station was on the Black- wall Railway, less than a hundred yards away. Wrexham could go in at least three possible directions from there and end up anywhere in the city. <br> <br>But Wrexham kept moving, rapidly, right, past the way back up to the station. Instead, he turned left onto Three Colts Street, then swerved right onto Ropemaker&#x2019;s Field, still loping in an easy run. <br> <br>Pitt was too breathless to shout, and anyway Wrexham was no more than fifteen yards ahead. The few men and one old washer- woman on the path scattered as the three running men passed them. Wrexham was going to the river, as Pitt had feared. <br> <br>At the end of Ropemaker&#x2019;s Field they turned right again into Nar- row Street, still running. They were only yards from the river&#x2019;s edge. The breeze was stiff off the water, smelling of salt and mud where the tide was low. Half a dozen gulls soared lazily in circles above a string of barges. <br> <br>Wrexham was still ahead of them, moving less easily now, tiring. He passed the entrance to Limehouse Cut. Pitt figured that he must be making for Kidney Stairs, the stone steps down to the river, where, if they were lucky, he would find a ferry waiting. There were two more sets of stairs before the road curved twenty yards inland to Broad Street. At the Shadwell Docks there were more stairs again. He could lose his pursuers on any of them. <br> <br>Gower gestured toward the river. &#x201c;Steps!&#x201d; he shouted, bending a moment and gasping to catch his breath. He gestured with a wild swing of his arm. Then he straightened up and began running again, a couple of strides ahead of Pitt. <br> <br>Pitt could see a ferry coming toward the shore, the boatman pulling easily at the oars. He would get to the steps a moment or two after Wrexham&#x2014;in fact Pitt and Gower would corner him nicely. Perhaps they could get the ferry to take them up to the Pool of London. He ached to sit down even for that short while. <br> <br>Wrexham reached the steps and ran down them, disappearing as if he had slipped into a hole. Pitt felt an upsurge of victory. The ferry was still twenty yards from the spot where the steps would meet the water. <br> <br>Gower let out a yell of triumph, waving his hand high. <br> <br>They reached the top of the steps just as the ferry pulled away, Wrexham sitting in the stern. They were close enough to see the smile on his face as he half swiveled on the seat to gaze at them. Then he faced forward, speaking to the ferryman and pointing to the farther shore. <br> <br>Pitt raced down the steps. His feet slithered on the wet stones. He waved his arms at the other ferry, the one they had seen. &#x201c;Here! Hurry!&#x201d; he shouted. <br> <br>Gower shouted also, his voice high and desperate. <br> <br>The ferryman increased his speed, throwing his full weight be- hind his oars, and in a matter of seconds had swung around next to the pier. <br> <br>&#x201c;Get in, gents,&#x201d; he said cheerfully. &#x201c;Where to?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;After that boat there,&#x201d; Gower gasped, choking on his own breath and pointing to the other ferry. &#x201c;An extra half crown in it for you if you catch up with him before he gets up Horseferry Stairs.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt landed in the boat behind him and immediately sat down so they could get under way. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to Horseferry,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going straight across. Look!&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Lavender Dock?&#x201d; Gower scowled, sitting in the seat beside Pitt. &#x201c;What the hell for?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Shortest way across,&#x201d; Pitt replied. &#x201c;Get up to Rotherhithe Street and away.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Where to?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Nearest train station, probably. Or he might double back. Best place to get lost is among other people.&#x201d; <br> <br>They were pulling well away from the dock now and slowly catching up with the other ferry. <br> <br>There were fewer ships moored here, and they could make their way almost straight across.

Like most Americans, he was soon led to believe in a world-wide Communist conspiracy that menaced the United States, forcing the nation into a disastrous war in Korea. But once he joined the U.S. Air Force and began flying top-secret missions as a navigator and intelligence officer, what he learned was eye-opening. He saw that even as the U.S. preached about peace and freedom, it was engaging in an endless cycle of warfare, bringing devastation and oppression to fledgling democracies across the globe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, after fifty years as a renowned cultural historian, Franklin offers a set of hard-learned lessons about modern American history. <i>Crash Course </i>is essential reading for anyone who wonders how America ended up where it is today: with a deeply divided and disillusioned populace, led by a dysfunctional government, and mired in unwinnable wars. It also finds startling parallels between America&#x2019;s foreign military exploits and the equally brutal tactics used on the home front to crush organized labor, antiwar, and civil rights movements.<br> &nbsp;<br> More than just a memoir or a history book, <i>Crash Course </i>gives readers a unique firsthand look at the building of the American empire and the damage it has wrought. Shocking and gripping as any thriller, it exposes the endless deception of the American public, and reveals from inside how and why many millions of Americans have been struggling for decades against our own government in a fight for peace and justice. &nbsp;</p><p>H. BRUCE FRANKLIN is a former Air Force navigator and intelligence officer, a progressive activist, and the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies, emeritus at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. He is the author or editor of nineteen books, and has received lifetime achievement awards from the American Studies Association and other major academic organizations.<br> &nbsp;"A compelling memoir mixed with original historical research leading to fresh interpretations of the permanent war culture."&nbsp; (<i>Kirkus *starred* review</i>)<br><br>"It's especially stunning for me personally, to read Franklin's gripping account of the era we both lived through--three years apart in age--and to realize that we followed the same unusual trajectory in beliefs and attitudes: both committed Cold Warriors at the outset--my service in the Marine Corps and working on nuclear war plans in the Pentagon overlapping his active service in the Strategic Air Command rehearsing the catastrophic enactment of such plans--his disillusion with the Vietnam war and his turn to active resistance shortly preceding my own. Readers of any age will find this an exciting and startlingly self-aware memoir of a life transformed in our dangerous epoch, and most will find in it radically new perspectives on these perilous times, up to the present mind-boggling moment. A terrific book!" (Daniel Ellsberg <i>author of The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner</i>)<br><br>"Only the late great Howard Zinn comes close to H.Bruce Franklin as truth-telling historian whose 'the personal is political' oeuvre should be read by every American, left or right, who aspires to be informed beyond headlines and rumor. Franklin&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Crash Course: From the Good War to the Forever War</i>, meticulously researched, factually inarguable, is also a fascinating memoir in which the past is always prologue to the nearly out-of-body experience in which we find ourselves today. From 1939 through WWII to Korea to Vietnam to Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria to whatever is next: isn&#x2019;t it time we figure out how we got here? May H. Bruce Franklin&#x2019;s incendiary&nbsp;<i>Crash Course</i>&nbsp;crash into discussion on every street corner, in every board room, classroom, and bedroom in these our United States, and in the world beyond." (Jayne Anne Phillips <i>National Book Award Finalist, author, Machine Dreams and Lark &amp; Termite</i>)<br><br>"Two threads are skillfully interwoven in this absorbing memoir: the record of a remarkable life, with rich and varied experience; and astute analysis of the background of critical historical events. The outcome is a fascinating picture of post-World War II America, all under the grim shadow of 'forever war.'" (Noam Chomsky <i>Institute Professor Emeritus, MIT, author of Requiem for the American Dream</i>)<br><br>"<i>Crash Course&nbsp;</i>is a fabulous blend of exceptional memoir and astute political&nbsp;analysis. A quintessential American story of political coming-of-age. Highly&nbsp;recommended." (Richard Falk <i>Professor Emeritus, International Law, Princeton University, and author of Palestine's Horizon:</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a deeply personal and compelling account of Franklin&#x2019;s lifelong entanglement with America&#x2019;s perpetual war state, from his youthful enthusiasms, to his years of flight in the Strategic Air Command, to his sustained resistance to the Vietnam War, which changed his life in so many ways. &nbsp;Franklin has been one of the major scholars of America&#x2019;s post-WWII commitment to war as policy, and here we learn how that happened. It&#x2019;s a rousing and inspirational life story!&#x201d; (Kim Stanley Robinson <i>Hugo Award winner and author of New York 2140</i>)<br><br>"A scorching overview of the militarization of America that is simultaneously the engrossing autobiography of an historian who came of age in World War Two and the early Cold War years.<i>&nbsp;Crash Course</i>&nbsp;is a vivid and sobering eyeopener for readers at every level from students to fellow seniors to everyone in between."&nbsp; (John Dower <i>MIT Ford International Professor of History, Emeritus, and author of The Violent American Century:</i>)<br><br>"A required course for everyone concerned about how militarization has shaped American society and national identity from World War II through interventions in Korea and Vietnam to the current endless war on terror. Especially engaging is the interweaving of personal memoir and political analysis, of social life and foreign policy, by one of our greatest myth busters." (Amy Kaplan <i>University of Pennsylvania, author of Our American Israel: the Story of an Entangled Alliance</i>)<br><br>"Brooklyn boy, New York Longshoreman, US Air Force Navigator, English Professor, and human rights and anti-war activist, H. Bruce Franklin is one of our most important and enduring public intellectuals. Part memoir and part historical analysis, Franklin&#x2019;s newest book explains how our 'glorious atomic victory in World War II' carried us relentlessly into the disastrous Vietnam War and our present campaigns in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Will we ever learn? <i>Crash Course</i> should be required reading by every American." (John Carlos Rowe <i>University of Southern California, and author of The Cultural Politics of the New American Studies</i>)<br><br>"A passionate activist scholar, Franklin skillfully harnesses his lively and scrupulously candid autobiography to a deeply researched history of the emergence in the U.S. since World War II of what he calls the Forever War, which he places in compelling counterpoint to the growth of the wide-spread anti-war movement and allied progressive causes to which he himself was an important contributor.&nbsp; A terrific read."

The author lyrically evokes his privileged childhood on an Adirondack estate, a colorful uncle who was a pioneer aviator and fighter ace, and his first explorations of the larger world he encountered as he came of age in the tumultuous 1960s. But above all this is a story of a father and his only son and of the unexpected peace finally made between them.</p><p>"An exquisite memoir of a boy growing up: of a world of privilege and the one beyond. It is in coming to under- stand his powerful father that Adam Hochschild is able to under- stand both worlds." --Studs Terkel <p>"I loved reading <i>Half the Way Home</i>. It is such a gentle book, its eloquence so delicate--and at the same time very strong, dealing as it does with such an exceptionally, intensely difficult relationship." --Alice Adams </p><p>"His story is fascinating, and the portrait of a lost childhood offered here evokes one of the archetypal dreams of the American mind." --E. L. Doctorow </p><p>"I was so moved, disturbed and diverted by this beautifully plain account of the most complicated and delicate set of emotions, not just between father and son but more widely between the mystery of power and powerlessness." --Nadine Gordimer</p><p>ADAM HOCHSCHILD is the author of ten books.&nbsp;<i>King Leopold&#x2019;s Ghost</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, as was <i>To End All Wars.</i> His&nbsp;<i>Bury the Chains</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the National Book Award and won the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize and PEN USA Literary Award.

As the volume progresses chronologically from the rise of a black aesthetic criticism, through the Blacks Arts Movement, feminism, structuralism and poststructuralism, and the rise of queer theory, it focuses on the key arguments, themes, and debates in each period. By constantly bringing attention to the larger political and cultural issues at stake in the interpretation of literary texts, the critics gathered here have contributed mightily to the prominence and popularity of African American literature in this country and abroad. African American Literary Theory provides a unique historical analysis of how these thinkers have shaped literary theory, and literature at large, and will be a indispensable text for the study of African American intellectual culture.

She lives in Toronto with her long-suffering husband and her two children, and to her regret has no dogs.<br>She can be found @msagara on Twitter or http://msagarawest.wordpress.com</p><br><br>To say that Private Kaylin Neya was out of her element was to master the art of understatement. Fish out of water had nothing on the groundhawk whose entire life had been lived within the boundaries of Elantra&#x2014;either on the city streets or in the fiefs at its heart.<br><br>This had become obvious the moment she entered the forest, walking between Severn and Teela and surrounded&#x2014;literally&#x2014;by Barrani. Or as she walked through forest, at any rate, because this far across the known map, it was <em>all</em> forest. Never an aficionado of fine art, she'd nonetheless seen paintings, and the occasional diorama of ancient forests, and she had known what to expect: tall, majestic trees, shade-dappled forest floors and shafts of brilliant, solid sunlight illuminating strategic patches of charming undergrowth, with the occasional frail animal thrown in for good measure. In the paintings, there were no Barrani, no dragons, and no angry Leontines; there were no drug dealers, no muggers, no frauds, and no rapists. The artists evoked a sense of peaceful idyll. Hah.<br><br>Painters should have been Court diplomats&#x2014;men and women who'd mastered the art of telling pretentious lies with more or less straight faces. For one, they left out the bugs. On some level, Kaylin didn't blame them&#x2014;if she'd had the choice, she'd've left them out, too. Unfortunately, she didn't. The insects didn't appear to bother the Barrani. She was glad&#x2014;in an entirely petty way&#x2014;that they occasionally bit Severn, because it made their choice of dinner snacks racial, rather than purely personal. He didn't appear to take offense as much.<br><br>Then again, he had other things on his mind, chief among them, not tripping over inconveniently placed tree roots and landing on his face. His left eye had, over the course of two days, developed a purple-black tinge. He'd taken one wound to his upper left thigh, and two broad gashes across his left rib cage, one of which had exposed bone. He'd allowed her to heal the wounds by a few days' worth, no more.<br><br>This was a greater liberty than any of the injured Barrani allowed her, and she was tired enough not to push the point. The Barrani version of gratitude for the gift of healing involved knives&#x2014;or worse&#x2014;in dark alleys.<br><br>Avoiding Barrani, however, was not an option.<br><br>The Lord of the West March and what remained of his soldiers formed up at the front&#x2014;and the rear&#x2014;of the delegation. To either side, what was left of the party that had set out from the High Halls walked in single file. Kaylin wasn't given the option of choosing her position in that delegation: she was wearing a very fine, obviously magical, green dress, and the <em>dress</em> demanded respect, even if the wearer didn't.<br><br><em>Travel,</em> some idiot in her office had said, <em>is fun.</em><br><br>Kaylin, surrounded by somber, tense&#x2014;and deeply blueeyed Barrani&#x2014;had a few words to say about <em>that.</em> Teela made clear she could say them with her mouth shut. So Kaylin, navigating forest, footpaths, and a plague of blood-drinking, buzzing insects, began to make a list. It was, in her mind, titled Things Not to Do if You Want to Have Fun During Your Involuntary Leave of (Probably Unpaid) Absence.<br><br>First on the list: avoid making deals for crucial information with a fieflord. Even if the Halls of Law were desperate for that information. The particular fieflord in question, Lord Nightshade, didn't seem to have any trouble navigating the forest, and the insects avoided him. He wore a tiara with an emerald at its peak, and robes that looked ridiculously fine in comparison to the practical Barrani armor that almost everyone else was wearing. She added a corollary to the first point: do not agree to attend a religious rite in the West March without first ascertaining that the fieflord in question did not also plan to attend.<br><br>Second on the list: do not travel with the Barrani High Court. It had seemed both convenient and smart to accept their offer of transportation; after all, the Barrani knew where they were going. Kaylin didn't. Her knowledge of Elantran streets was second to none&#x2014;or close&#x2014;but the West March wasn't <em>in</em> Elantra. At the time, because she'd had no idea how to <em>reach</em> the West March, getting there on her own had seemed impossible.<br><br>Impossible couldn't be worse than this. She slapped her arm and squashed an insect. The chill in the air, as she smeared insect body across the sleeve of her incredibly important ceremonial dress, could have frozen moving water.<br><br>If the imaginary person for whom the list was being created had had no choice in either of the first two, she emphatically underlined point three: if you see a strange dress in a closet that only appeared <em>after</em> you'd entered the room of your inn, <em>ignore it.</em> Under no circumstances was such a dress to be worn. Unless you were Barrani, and maybe not even then. Yes, the dress was a lovely shade of green. Yes, it was comfortable. Yes, it was suitable for the Barrani High Court&#x2014;and it didn't require the help of two strong people to put on. It was even practical; the skirts were wide enough that Kaylin could run&#x2014;at full stride&#x2014;while wearing it.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Barrani didn't respect or revere it because it was practical. They revered it because it was the manifestation of the will of the heart of the green. Some poor sucker, shoehorned into the dress, was meant to serve in a primary role in the recitation of the regalia&#x2014;the very rite that a smart person would have gone out of their way to avoid attending if they were paying attention to point one.<br><br>Fourth on the list&#x2014;although technically, it might be better placed between points two and three: avoid Barrani inns. The Barrani version of an inn was known as a Hallionne. Or the Hallionne, in plural. As inns went they were creepy, in part because they were alive and sentient&#x2014;and mind-reading. Best not to forget the mind-reading part. They reminded Kaylin of nothing so much as the Towers or Castles in the fiefs, and no one with two brain cells to rub together voluntarily lived in either. She felt a twinge of guilt at this because she counted Tara, the Tower of Tiamaris, as a friend. But it had been a long two days&#x2014;it was a very minor twinge.<br><br>Because the Hallionne were sentient, they were able to do things that normal inns couldn't&#x2014;like, say, choose the rooms in which their guests stayed. Want a different room? Too damn bad. You could stay in the room the Hallionne chose for you&#x2014;or you could sleep under the trees, where the forest version of Ferals would eat your liver for a midnight snack. The Hallionne also had a pretty broad idea of physical shape and changed it apparently at whim.<br><br>The small dragon perched on her shoulder tilted his head, and after a pause, squawked in her ear.<br><br>Point five, which might also be point zero: do not take large, strange eggs home with you. They hatched into delicate, small dragons. Not that the actual dragons of Kaylin's acquaintance thought so&#x2014;but honestly, the little guy had miniature dragon breath. Except he didn't spew flame; he spewed...clouds. That could melt steel without heating it first. That could kill Ferals. That could bypass the usual magical wards placed on doors.<br><br><em>Squawk.</em><br><br>Or maybe point five should be: do not have a dragon for a roommate. Because dragons for roommates attracted assassins the way Kaylin was currently attracting insects&#x2014;and if you were planning on killing a dragon, you'd need enough magical conflagration to destroy a city block.<br><br>Or two.<br><br>And that much magic had certainly been enough to destroy the only home Kaylin had ever truly owned. Or rented. On the other hand, if your life goal was to live in the Palace, dragon roommates who just happened to be the only living female of the species were definitely the way to go.<br><br>The small dragon squawked again.<br><br>"All right, all right. Scratch that. Unhatched eggs are good." Especially since the act of hatching seemed responsible for the fact that Kaylin&#x2014;and Bellusdeo, the maligned dragon roommate in question&#x2014;were still alive. That was not the usual outcome when an Arcane bomb exploded in your face.<br><br>He squawked.<br><br>"They're bad?"<br><br>"Lord Kaylin," Severn said. She glanced at him. "Is there some difficulty?" His words were both High Barrani and stiff as boards. They reminded her, immediately, that she was surrounded by Barrani Lords who were just as stiff, but probably less friendly. You could get some warmth out of most boards by burning them; at this point, Kaylin wasn't so certain the same could be said of the High Court, or at least its present members. Only Nightshade looked amused.<br><br>Amusing Nightshade was not high on her list of things to do, although it didn't quite make the list of things not to do she was composing.<br><br>Let's see. Six? Six: if a Hallionne offered to let you stay in his special, safe space, and the space looked like a haunted graveyard, <em>don't do it.</em><br><br>She was aware, as she stubbed her toe for the thousandth time, that she was being more than a little unfair. But the imitation graveyard had been a bedroom, of sorts. In the heart of the Hallionne, his brothers slept.<br><br>Small and squawky dragon sidekick had breathed on their tombstones, which had caused them to wake. The waking had been disturbing. The brothers themselves, disturbing as well but in a different way&#x2014;they'd adopted the forms of Barrani Lords, but the minute they'd opened their collective mouths it was clear they had very, very little in common with the Hal-lionne's most frequent guests.<br><br>Seven: if the Hallionne offers to let you take the portal paths through the outlands to the West March, say no. Loudly. Le-ontine optional. In theory, the portal paths were risky. Theory and practice aligned, but not in the ways she'd been told to expect.<br><br>In theory, the outlands existed as a kind of potential space. They were gray and formless in their natural state. An entire group&#x2014;such as, say, the group that set out from the High Halls what felt like months ago&#x2014;could pass through the arch of the portal intent on reaching the same destination, but only two people were guaranteed to do so.<br><br>One of them was Kaylin Neya, wearer of the dress that deserved respect.<br><br>The other was Lord Nightshade, wearer of the emerald tiara. Like Kaylin's dress, the tiara was given to someone chosen to participate directly in the recitation of the regalia. Unlike Kaylin, Nightshade seemed to approve.<br><br>She'd been surprised to enter the outlands to find the bowers of normal, if tall, trees. So had the Consort. The Consort. Kaylin wanted to add an eighth item to her growing list: <em>don't piss off the Consort.</em> But in this case, she couldn't. Kaylin understood why the Consort was angry. She also understood that given the same possible outcomes, Kaylin would stand by the choice she'd made.<br><br>She glanced at the Consort as she thought it; the Consort was dressed in white armor, a gift from the Lord of the West March. She carried a naked blade, and her hair was swept off the back of her neck. She was, on the other hand, the only Barrani to confine her hair. As if aware of Kaylin's attention, the Consort glanced at her. Her eyes were blue. They were not as dark a blue as almost everyone else's.<br><br>Teela's were certainly darker.<br><br>"Honestly, kitling," the Barrani Hawk said, frowning. "I can <em>hear</em> you thinking."<br><br>On most days, the Barrani who worked in the Halls of Law looked both arrogant and bored. At thirteen years of age, Kaylin had found the arrogance irritating. The boredom, she understood. Today, she missed it.<br><br>"Teela&#x2014;"<br><br>"If I hear one more word about the insects, I swear I will bite you myself." She spoke in quiet Elantran for the first time in two days.<br><br>The rush of gratitude Kaylin felt at the sound of her mother tongue should have embarrassed her. Clearly, from Teela's expression, it embarrassed one of them. "Do <em>not,"</em> Teela continued in the same Elantran, her brows furrowing, "start to worry about me."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"I mean it."<br><br>"Can I talk about something else instead?"<br><br>"I'm certain to regret it," was Teela's brusque reply. As it wasn't a no, Kaylin said, "Why do so many Barrani try to divest themselves of their names?"<br><br>"Do they?"<br><br>"Illien in Barren. The walking dead in Nightshade."<br><br>"Two small examples do not constitute a multitude."<br><br>"Well, no. But I think that's what Iberrienne was trying to do."<br><br>Teela shook her head. "I think you're wrong."<br><br>Kaylin wasn't so certain. Eighth on her list, then: do not speak the True Name of a Barrani Lord who you don't intend to kill immediately afterward. She hadn't planned it. But she had seen Ynpharion's True Name, and she had seen the substantial shadows it both cast and fed. The shadow had taken the form of his name, and the shape. It was as if he had two names, identical in form, but entirely different in substance.<br><br>She didn't understand how. But she was certain that the shadow name&#x2014;for want of anything else to call it&#x2014;had given the Barrani Lord the ability to transform himself into the Ferals that hunted in the less safe parts of the West March and its environs. It was as a Feral that he had first approached Kaylin.<br><br>It was as a Feral that he would have killed her, too. But her dragon sidekick had conferred a type of invisibility on her. Or on himself. That invisibility had given her the time to observe, and the time to plan&#x2014;even if the plan was half-assed and desperate.<br><br>She knew the True Names of both Lord Nightshade and the Lord of the West March. She understood that in theory, this gave her power over them. But she now understood that theory was its usual pathetic mess. Neither Nightshade nor the Lord of the West March had ever fought against her knowledge. They accepted the threat she might one day pose. They did not feel threatened by her <em>now.</em><br><br>They had, she understood, gifted her with the knowledge of their names.<br><br>But Lord Ynpharion had not. She'd spoken his name, strengthening its existence, in an attempt to burn away the shadows that clung to it. She'd succeeded. But there had been no way to ask his permission because before she had invoked his name, he wouldn't have given it. He fought her.<br><br>He fought, and he lost. This was a new and painful experience for Kaylin, and it was not one she was anxious to repeat.<br><br>Ynpharion walked to one side of the Lord of the West March, in what should have been a position of honor. To the naked eye, he was as proud, as focused, as unflappable as any other Barrani present.<br><br>But Kaylin saw beneath that surface. She saw his self-loathing, his disgust, and his fury&#x2014;most of it aimed squarely at her. The only reason he kept it to himself was his fear of exposure. Kaylin held his name.<br><br></p><h2>Stopping Inflammation: Relieving the Cause of Degenerative Diseases</h2><p><p>Most of us think of inflammation as a symptom associated with an infection or injury. Dr. Nancy Appleton, however, has discovered that it might be more than just a simple reaction to a health disorder. When the body&#x2019;s tissues are disturbed in some manner, a series of complex reactions takes place, resulting in inflammation. In most cases, when the disorder stops, the tissue returns to its normal healthy state. Sometimes, though, the tissue remains chronically inflamed. Dr. Appleton&#x2019;s research demonstrates&nbsp;that this condition might be more harmful than ever suspected.</p> <p>Drawing on the latest medical research, <i>Stopping Inflammation </i>begins with a full explanation of inflammation and its causes. It then looks at inflammation&#x2019;s role in&nbsp;various health disorders, from obesity to cancer. Finally, the book provides a number of nondrug treatments aimed not at controlling the problem, but at removing its cause. Here are safe and credible solutions for restoring good health.</p></p><p><p>Nancy Appleton, PhD,</p> <p>earned her BS in clinical nutrition from UCLA and her PhD in health services from Walden University. She maintains a private practice in Santa Monica, California. An avid researcher, Dr. Appleton lectures throughout the world, and has appeared on numerous television and radio shows. She is the best-selling author of <i><strong>Suicide by Sugar</strong> </i>and <i>Healthy Bones. </i></p><p>Degenerative diseases appear to be caused or complicated by a process few medical researchers suspected until quite recently: inflammation. Scientists have long linked edema, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease to inflammation, but have only recently implicated the process to diabetes, certain cancers, and other unsolvable degenerative conditions. The latest research links heart disease more to various inflammatory conditions (those ending with &#x2019;itis&#x2019;) than to high cholesterol. Inflammation has always played a role in infections. Catch a cold or fever and the nose runs, coughing sets in, temperature rises, and all the other great symptoms that children pray for, as an excuse to ditch school, appear. All of these symptoms are expressions of the inflammatory process. Another form of inflammation has to do with insults to the body, such as parasites, fungi, bruises, broken bones, and smoking. Healthy immune systems use inflammation to right an unbalanced body; when the job is done, inflammation and other symptoms go away.</p> <p>Blood tests often show chronic, low-grade inflammation in the body. All of the known related problems have been studied and inflammation can&#x2019;t be linked to any specific cause. Maybe investigators aren&#x2019;t looking in the right direction for answers. Where does this inflammation with no known cause come from? Is there a way that we can stop this process before it even gets started? Can we prevent diseases? Are you tired of taking anti inflammatory pills?</p> <p>Are you inflicted with an acute, chronic, or degenerative disease and still searching for an answer? This book will give you a fresh look at your health and how to heal yourself.</p> <p>Research has shown me that many of the serious, unsolved diseases of modern civilization are expressions of chronic inflammatory processes. Medical therapy is often directed at controlling symptoms rather than removing their cause. My intent is to show you how your own lifestyle can cause inflammation, resulting in disease. I will then provide you with techniques you can use, techniques to effectively respond to an out-of-control immune system and prevent or naturally abort the inflammation process.</p> <p>Throughout this book, my objective is four-fold:</p> <p>1. To present the latest research that supports the link between inflammation and disease.</p> <p>2. To outline alternative causes for conditions that are presently listed in the mainstream literature as having &#x201c;unknown cause.&#x201d;</p> <p>3. To reiterate the importance of finding the sources of your health problems.</p> <p>4.

Winner of Japan&#x2019;s top literary prizes for fiction (among them the Akutagawa, the Tanizaki, the Noma, and the Yomiuri), Taeko Kono writes with a strange beauty, pinpricked with sadomasochistic and disquieting scenes.</p><p>In the title story, the protagonist loathes young girls, but compulsively buys expensive clothes for little boys so that she can watch them dress and undress. The impersonal gaze Taeko Kono turns on this behavior transfixes the reader with a fatal question: What are we hunting for? And why?</p><p>Multiplying perspectives and refracting light from the strangely facing mirrors of fantasy and reality, pain and pleasure, these ten stories present Kono at her very best.</p></p><p><p>Born in Tokyo, <strong>Taeko Kono</strong> (1926&#x2013;2015) was &#x201c;one of the most significant feminist writers of postwar Japan&#x201d; (<em>Japan Times</em>).</p><p>Lucy North is a Japanese translator and editor based in the southeast of England.</p>&#x201c;Kono&#x2019;s intimate descriptions of unhappy relationships are not only unexpectedly frank, but often genuinely shocking.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Boston Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Japanese master of the unsettling: Kono should be an electrifying discovery for English-speaking lovers of short fiction. Each story unburies something that feels both thrillingly specific and surprisingly contemporary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Provocative and eerily moving in their confrontation of the terrifying and the taboo. Each of Kono&#x2019;s stories features characters confronting new ways to live with their own secret selves: a strikingly original and surprising collection.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Both the sadism and masochism here is very raw&#x2015;but pain and pleasure mingle in ways that never cease to be surprising or poetic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thessaly La Force, <em>T-Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The fiery, beguiling stories in <em>Toddler Hunting and Other Stories</em> are vertiginous tightrope walks between two planes of reality. Kono&#x2019;s writing is shocking, ominous, and subversive; it lays bare the destruction and the renewal that freedom and desire can cause.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Paris Review Daily</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Two currents are constantly crossing in the stories, the first depicting the polite forms of public interactions and the second pulsing with taboo fantasies and hallucinations. There are resonances here with Tanizaki, but Kono&#x2019;s subversions feel somehow scarier, in part because of her deadpan prose and in part because she strikes at sacred paradigms of motherhood and femininity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Reminiscent of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s works, Kono&#x2019;s stories explore the dark, terrifying side of human nature that manifests itself in antisocial behavior.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>World Literature Today</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I was not prepared for this unsettling and unforgettable collection. These stories left me shaken and in awe; they are incendiary, beautiful, and frightening confrontations of the lives we keep hidden from others. Taeko Kono fearlessly writes into the abyss, and there is no one like her.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gabe Habash, author of Stephen Florida</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Kono&#x2019;s unsparing gaze penetrates the depths of human nature, and she sets forth what she finds there with absolute precision.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Shusaku Endo</strong></p><h2>Living the Illumined Life</h2><p>&#x201c;There are two ways of life open to a person here on earth,&#x201d; says Joel Goldsmith in Living the Illumined Life. &#x201c;There is the human way, the way of the unillumined, and there is the spiritual way, the way of the illumined.&#x201d;What is the difference? The unillumined individual is living by and through his own powers, wisdom, and strength, Goldsmith explains. It is a life of toil, effort, and worry, often limited in education, limited in experience, limited in background, or limited in finances. The illumined individual is living in conscious awareness of an indwelling Presence, Being, Power. He has realized that he is not living his life alone: &#x201c;I live, yet not I; this spirit of the Lord God which is upon me is living my life.&#x201d; This is a life of infinite capacity and complete freedom.Goldsmith boldly asks the reader: &#x201c;Do you believe that the spirit of God dwells in you? Do you believe there is an indwelling Christ in you? Do you believe that you are the temple of God? Do you believe that you can do all things through Christ that dwells in you?&#x201d; If you cannot answer in the affirmative, he says, you are still the unillumined. But, he encourages, you are the one who can change that.For those who are inspired to make the transition and live life as one of the illumined, Living the Illumined Life clearly lays out the principles and practices that can purify consciousness and lift the sincere seeker to the awareness of the Presence and Power within. Then as illumination comes, he can walk free and unfettered, without fear, by Grace.[Note: Living the Illumined Life is the collection of the 1972 Infinite Way Letters.]</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;<p>"A new generation of mature seekers, receptive to spiritual truth, is now discovering Joel Goldsmith's teachings, which have lost none of their relevance, aliveness and power. I foresee that those teachings will reach and impact even more people in the 21st century than during his lifetime. Joel Goldsmith's inspired and profoundly inspiring books represent a vital contribution to the spiritual awakening of humanity." </p><p>-- Eckhart Tolle</p></p><h2>The Underworld U.S.A.

He panic-popped the brakes. He induced a rear-end skid. AWells Fargo armored car clipped the milk truck side/head-on.<br><br> <i>Mark it now:<br></i><br> 7:16 A.M. South L.A., 84th and Budlong. Residential darktown. Shit shacks with dirt front yards.<br><br> The jolt stalled out both vehicles. The milk truck driver hit the dash. The driver&#x2019;s side door blew wide. The driver keeled and hit the sidewalk. He was a fortyish male Negro.<br><br> The armored car notched some hood dents. Three guards got out and scoped the damage. They were white men in tight khakis. They wore Sam Browne belts with buttoned pistol flaps.<br><br> They knelt beside the milk truck driver. The guy twitched and gasped. The dashboard bounce gouged his forehead. Blood dripped into his eyes.<br><br> <i>Mark it now:<br></i><br> 7:17 A.M. Winter overcast. This quiet street. No foot traffic. No car-crash hubbub yet.<br><br> The milk truck heaved. The radiator blew. Steam hissed and spread wide. The guards coughed and wiped their eyes. Three men got out of a &#x2019;62 Ford parked two curb lengths back.<br><br> They wore masks. They wore gloves and crepe-soled shoes. They wore utility belts with gas bombs in pouches. They were long-sleeved and buttoned up. Their skin color was obscured.<br><br> Steam covered them. They walked up and pulled silencered pieces. The guards coughed. It supplied sound cover. The milk truck driver pulled a silencered piece and shot the nearest guard in the face.<br><br> The noise was a thud. The guard&#x2019;s forehead exploded. The two other guards fumble-grabbed at their holsters. The masked men shot them in the back. They buckled and pitched forward. The masked men shot them in the head point-blank. The thuds and skull crack muffle-echoed.<br><br> It&#x2019;s 7:19 A.M. It&#x2019;s still quiet. There&#x2019;s no foot traffic and car-crash hubbub yet.<br><br> Noise now&#x2014;two gunshots plus loud echoes. Muzzle flare, weird-shaped, blasts from the armored car&#x2019;s gun slit.<br><br> The shots ricocheted off the pavement. The masked men and the milk truck driver threw themselves prone. They rolled <i>toward</i> the armored car. It blitzed firing range. Four more shots popped. Four plus two&#x2014;one revolver load.<br><br> Masked Man #1 was tall and thin. Masked Man #2 was midsized. Masked Man #3 was heavyset. It&#x2019;s 7:20 A.M. There&#x2019;s still no foot traffic. This big blimp up in the sky trailed department-store banners.<br><br> Masked Man #1 stood up and crouched under the gun slit. He pulled a gas bomb from his pouch and yanked the top. Fumes sputtered. He stuffed the bomb in the gun slit. The guard inside shrieked and retched very loud. The back door crashed outward. The guard jumped and hit the pavement on his knees. He bled from the nose and the mouth. Masked Man #2 shot him twice in the head.<br><br> The milk truck driver put on a gas mask. The masked men put gas masks on over their face masks. Gas whooshed out the back door. Masked Man #1 popped gas bomb #2 and lobbed it inside.<br><br> The fumes flared and settled into acid mist&#x2014;red, pink, transparent. A street hubbub started perking. There&#x2019;s some window peeps, some open doors, some colored folks on their porches.<br> It&#x2019;s 7:22 A.M. The fumes have dispersed. There&#x2019;s no second guard inside.<br><br> Now they go in.<br><br> They fit tight. It was a cramped space. Cash bags and attach� cases were stacked in wall racks. Masked Man #1 made the count: sixteen bags and fourteen cases.<br><br> <i>They grabbed. </i>Masked Man #2 had a burlap bag stuffed down his pants. He pulled it out and held it open.<br><br> <i>They grabbed. </i>They stuffed the bag. One attach� case snapped open. They saw mounds of plastic-wrapped emeralds.<br><br> Masked Man #3 opened a cash bag. A C-note roll poked out. He tugged on the bank tab. Ink jets sprayed him and hit his mask holes. He got ink in his mouth and ink in his eyes.<br><br> He gasped, he spit ink, he rubbed his eyes and tripped out the door. He shit in his pants and stood around flailing. Masked Man #1 stepped clear of the door and shot him twice in the back.<br><br> It&#x2019;s 7:24 A.M. <i>Now </i>there&#x2019;s hubbub. It&#x2019;s a jungle din confined to porches.<br><br> Masked Man #1 walked toward it. He pulled four gas bombs, popped the tops and lobbed them. He threw left and right. Fumes rose up red, pink and transparent. Acid sky, mini-storm front, rainbow. The porch fools whooped and coughed and ran inside their shacks.<br><br> The milk truck driver and Masked Man #2 stuffed four burlap bags tight. They got the full load: all thirty cash sacks and cases. They walked to the &#x2019;62 Ford. Masked Man #1 opened the trunk. They dumped the bags in.<br><br> 7:26 A.M.<br><br> A breeze kicked up. Wind swirled the gas clouds into wild fusing colors. The milk truck driver and Masked Man #2 gawked through their goggles.<br><br> Masked Man #1 stepped in front of them. They got pissy&#x2014;<i>Say what?&#x2014;</i>don&#x2019;t block the light show. Masked Man #1 shot them both in the face. Slugs blew up their goggle glass and gasmask tubes and doused their lights in a second.<br><br> <i>Mark it now:<br></i><br> 7:27 A.M. Four dead guards, three dead heist men. Pink gas clouds. Acid fallout. Fumes turning shrubs gray-malignant.<br><br> Masked Man #1 opened the driver&#x2019;s side door and reached under the seat. Right there: a blowtorch and a brown bag stuffed with scald-on-contact pellets. The pellets looked like a bird feed/jelly bean hybrid.<br><br> He worked slow.<br><br> He walked to Masked Man #3. He dropped pellets on his back and stuffed pellets in his mouth. He tapped his blowtorch and blazed the body. He walked to the milk truck driver and Masked Man #2. He dropped pellets on their backs and stuffed pellets in their mouths and blowtorched their bodies.<br><br> The sun was way up now. The gas fumes caught rays and made a small stretch of sky one big prism. Masked Man #1 drove away, southbound.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> He got there first. He always did. He bootjacked niggertown robbery squawks off patrol frequencies. He packed his own multiband squawk box.<br><br> He parked by the armored car and the milk truck. He looked down the street. He saw some coons eyeballing the carnage. The air stung. His first guess: gas bombs and a faked collision.<br><br> The coons saw him. They evinced their standard &#x2018;&#x2018;Oh shit&#x2019;&#x2019; looks. He heard sirens. The overlap said six or seven units. Newton and 77th Street&#x2014;two divisions rolling out. He had three minutes to look.<br><br> He saw the four dead guards. He saw two scorched dead men near the east curb back a few car lengths.<br><br> He ignored the guards. He checked out the burned men. They were deep-scorched down to crackle skin, with their clothes swirled in. His first guess: instant double cross. Let&#x2019;s fuck up IDs on expendable partners.<br><br> The sirens whirred closer. A kid down the street waved at him. He bowed and waved back.<br><br> He had the gestalt already. Some shit you wait your whole life for. When it lands, <i>you know.<br></i><br> He was a big man. He wore a tweed suit and a tartan bow tie. Little 14&#x2019;s were stitched into the silk. He&#x2019;d shot and killed fourteen armed robbers.<br><br> NOW<br><br> <i>AMERICA</i>:<br><br> <i>I window-peeped four years of our History.

Now Mr. Benson has turned to Grahame's original work and created a delightful new edition, in which his magical illustrations give fresh life to Grahame's unforgettable story. <i>The Wind in the Willows </i>is the perfect companion to <i>The Willows in Winter.</i></p></p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud. Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> has enchanted readers for four generations, and this lavishly illustrated gift edition is perhaps the finest around. <i>(All ages, or 9 to 12)</i> <p>This reviews refers to ISBN 0805002138.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Feminist Ethic of Risk: Revised Edition (Other Feminist Voices)</h2><p>A Feminist Ethic of Risk proposes a new model for ethics and new life orientation for social justice.

One of the most significant aspects to this collection of quotes by the Sages is that in addition to pointing out that everything is a dreamlike illusion, the also point out in many of their quotes that upon Self Realization everything disappears. They also state that realizing that the world, etc. is an illusion is essential for Self Realization. The type is Palatino 15 for crisp clear easy reading. This book contains all of the quotes in Chapter (Step) Two from the book The Seven Steps to Awakening. Everything is an Illusion is Book Five in the Self Realization Series. One purpose of the Self Realization Series is to put just one category of quotes into a small book that has the advantage of making it easier to focus, meditate on, grasp and have insight into just one subject at a time. That makes the approach simple, easier and less complicated. The idea is to stay focused on just one subject until you have received everything you need to receive from that one subject. Most people go on to the next subject without ever having learned to apply to their lives the subject they are studying now. The Self Realization series of books are portable practice manuals aimed at helping sincere seekers of Self Realization master one Key to Self Realization at a time. The six titles in the Self Realization Series are: 1. Self Awareness Practice Instructions. 2. The Desire for Liberation. 3. The False self. 4. Inspiration and Encouragement on the Path to Self Realization. 5. Everything is an Illusion. 6. How Not to Get Lost in Concepts.</p><p></p><h2>World History Made Simple: Matching History with the Bible</h2><p>Sweep through all the world&#39;s history with this eye-opening trip.

She lives in Maine with her family. Visit her at cynthialord.com.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Two girls from seemingly different backgrounds bond over a blind dog and blueberries in Lord's latest heartwarmer. Lily lives in Maine, raised by her maternal grandparents, M�m�re and P�p�re. Her black lab, Lucky, is her strongest connection to her deceased mother. Lucky is slowly going blind and Lily is determined to raise money for an expensive and risky eye surgery to cure him; she paints wooden mason bee houses and sells them in her grandparent's general store. Salma is in Maine for the summer with her family, migrant workers who live and work in the blueberry barrens. Lucky unexpectedly brings the girls together and they immediately bond over their love of dogs, art, and blueberry enchiladas. Salma is creative and artistic, something that Lily both admires and envies. When Salma decides to enter the Blueberry Queen pageant&#x2014;something no migrant girl has ever done before&#x2014;Lily's eyes are opened to the microaggressions of some of the townsfolk. There's also the surprising support from Hannah, Lily's former best friend and reigning Blueberry Queen, who offers to loan Salma a gown. Through her friendship with Salma, the protagonist finds a confidence she didn't know she had and she begins to recognize and question her own previously unexamined biases. Despite the slim page count, this middle grade novel's plot evolves organically. Lord's characters reveal themselves slowly within the narrative and the Maine setting is richly described. The bright cover featuring an adorable black lab is pure shelfbait; though readers looking for a animal tale will instead find a story that centers more on family, friendship, and growing pains. VERDICT A thoughtful work that examines cultural bias and will spark discussion.&#x2014;Kiera Parrott, School Library Journal</p><h2>Wei wu Wei Ching</h2><p>&#34;This book is an attempt to put a collection of diamond cutting tools in the pocket of anyone who seriously wants to make use of them to realize enlightenment, the Self, Big Mind.&#34; ~from the Introduction Wei wu wei, or &#34;doing non-doing&#34;, is the central liberating idea of Zen, Ch&#39;an, Taoism, and -- under whatever name -- most every other enlightenment tradition in the world.

But the CIA&#39;s spies had few qualms when it came to cultivating terrorist organisations and interfering in the internal politics of Cold War Italy. Puppetmasters reveals how US intelligence services exploited the P2 masonic lodge to prop up friendly Christian Democrat-dominated governments and counter the growing political influence of the Italian Communist Party. It was a ruthless strategy involving coup plots, right wing terrorist bombings and the manipulation of the Red Brigades.

While his famously unassuming journeys around the globe have forged a signature philosophy of whimsy and practicality, they have also revealed the seemingly infinite booby traps of on-the-grid tourism. In a book with widespread cultural reverberations, Kugel takes the modern travel industry to task, determined to reignite humanity&#x2019;s age-old sense of adventure that has virtually been vanquished by the spontaneity-obliterating likes of Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and Starwood points. Woven throughout with vivid tales of his perfectly imperfect adventures, <em>Rediscovering Travel</em> explains&#x2015;often hilariously&#x2015;how to make the most of new digital technologies without being shackled to them. For the tight-belted tourist and the first-class flyer, the eager student and the comfort-seeking retiree, Kugel shows how we too can rediscover the joy of discovery.</p><p>&#34;My mother once told me it was more important in life to be interested than interesting. Seth Kugel is BOTH. He throws away the guidebooks and the picture-perfect brochures and proves the essential points that travel is not about the destination but the experience; it is not about the app or new technology but the conversation; and it is definitely not about the prearranged plan but about the imagination, and of course, the recovery when plan A doesn&#39;t work and the pleasant surprises that follow. That&#39;s what makes travel so appealing, so addictive, and that&#39;s what makes Rediscovering Travel so necessary.&#34;- Peter Greenberg, travel editor, CBS News<strong>Seth Kugel</strong>, the <em>New York Times</em>&#x2019;s &#x201c;Frugal Traveler&#x201d; from 2010 to 2016, has appeared on CBS <em>This Morning</em>, NPR, and BBC Travel.

Ultimately, <b>The Spell</b> details the restlessness of every human heart.</p><p>Alan Hollinghurst writes like a dream about the nightmare of unequal affection. In his third novel, <i>The Spell</i>, four men dance around one another, their emotions and actions ranging from casual cruelty to anxiety to adoration. Hollinghurst's painful but smiling roundelay alternates between Dorset--where 40ish architect Robin shares a house with the impossibly self-involved Justin--and London. When Justin's ex, Alex, arrives for a weekend in the country, the atmosphere is instantly rich with jealousy and power plays. And after the trio is joined by a younger gay man, Danny--who turns out to be Robin's son--the attractions and duplicities multiply exponentially. Alex, for instance, soon admits to Danny, "I've got a ruinous taste for takers," and they (and we) are off and running.<p> As ever, Hollinghurst's prose is musical and sensual but also deeply witty. Even the birds in this novel modulate their song from somnolent calls to outright chuckles--echoing the pleasures and absurdities of the humans they circle. And the author's feel for the easy intimacies and brutalities that his characters exchange is unmatched. As Justin (clad only in a tanga) escorts Alex around the cottage, he points out some vases: "These pots, darling, were made by potters of the greatest probity." Hollinghurst's descriptions are marvelous, whether of landscape or human frailty. After leaving a rather unrelaxed restaurant with Alex, "Danny recovered his air of bossiness and mystery, like a prefect in the school of pleasure." And when the two obtain some Ecstasy and hit one of Danny's haunts--a brilliantly realized club--the author reveals the rapture and idiocy in each moment: </p><blockquote> The boys glistened and pawed at the ground. They looked like members of some dodgy brainwashing cult.... Alex saw that what he most wanted was happening and groped marvellingly between the different kinds of happiness, the chemicals and the sex. It seemed that happening and happiness were the same, he must remember that, to tell everyone. </blockquote> But as amusing as Alan Hollinghurst is, his forte is loss. Again and again he reminds us that solitary sadness is a wink away from comedy and sexual possession. <i>--Kerry Fried</i><b>Alan Hollinghurst</b>&nbsp;is the author of the novels <i>The Stranger's Child,&nbsp;The Swimming-Pool Library, The Folding Star, The Spell,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The Line of Beauty,</i>&nbsp;which won the Man Booker Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Elphinston draws on many influences, including Shirley Sahrmann and Thomas Myers, to introduce new ways to look at movement dysfunction and musculoskeletal pain.

When I finally did set my foot on the ground, I found myself staring at the Central Station's dismal facade, along with the monument to Garibaldi, and a procession of faded green tramcars, rickety black taxis, and carriages drawn by small, sleepy horses. I turned and headed back the way I'd come until I reached Via Pietro Colletta, in the renowned Tribunali neighborhood. The sky was bright blue, as dazzling as on a postcard, and beneath that luminosity, amid buildings that rose here and there in no apparent order, like clouds, people came and went in a confused manner. At the beginning of Via Forcella, I stopped, somewhat perplexed. Farther up the street there was a great bustle, a wave of colors among which red and black stood out, and a buzz of mournful voices. A market, I thought, or a street fight. An old woman was sitting near a rock on a street corner and I stopped to ask her what all those people were doing. She raised her face, pitted by smallpox, and framed by a large black kerchief, and took a look for herself at that distant strip of sunlight at the heart of Forcella where the crowd was bulging like a snake, and the source of that intermittent mournful buzz. "No one's doing nothing, <i>signora</i>," she said calmly, in dialect, "you're dreaming."</p><br><p>It was years since I'd been down here, and I had forgotten that, along with Via San Biagio dei Librai, Via Forcella is one of the most densely populated streets in Naples, where the coming and going often gives one the sensation that something extraordinary must be happening. Through a veil of dust, the sun gave off a reddish glow that was no longer cheerful. From the thresholds of hundreds of small shops or from chairs set out along the sidewalks, women and children stared up at it with a strange, dazed air. Even the donkeys hitched to the vegetable carts seemed struck by the peculiar murkiness of the light, twitching their long ears in order to shoo the flies with a silent, apathetic patience. In a small pushcart, like those used by the sanitation authority, which seemed to have been momentarily abandoned in the middle of the street, a head could be seen; beneath it was the trunk of a man of about fifty, carefully dressed in a jacket buttoned to the neck and sewn at the sides and lower hemline like a sack. A small gilt plate tied to his chest with twine invited passers-by to give alms, but no one noticed him and, to tell the truth, not even he did much to attract the public's pity. With his cheek, reddened by wine, resting against a sack, his ears also reddened, even glowing, from wine, his white hair cascading over his eyebrows, and a delicate smile on his parted lips, the citizen slept. All around him, meanwhile, dwarves of both sexes passed by, decorously dressed in black, with pale, distorted faces, large sorrowful eyes, and twig-like fingers held at their chests, careful to avoid colliding with children and dogs. Other beggars, cripples or simply professionals, were sprawled on the ground wearing images of this or that patron saint around their necks or holding signs listing their misfortunes and children&#x2015;a sight that was replicated in the more fashionable streets of this city, in Chiaia or Piazza dei Martiri. They waited decorously, or dreamed. Several church bells rang out loudly, calling these souls to Mass.</p><br><p>As I came out of Forcella onto Via Duomo, the traffic seemed more orderly and almost silent, but soon became even louder again in the San Biago dei Librai district, which could be described as a continuation of Forcella.</p><br><p>Just like other ancient, impoverished streets in Naples, Via San Biagio dei Librai was packed with shops selling gold. Lackluster glass display cases, an excessively polished counter (so many ladies' elbows and hands having leaned on it for probably more than a century), a bespectacled maggot of a man who cautiously balances a shiny object in his hand and silently observes it, while a woman, young or old, standing before him at the counter, eyes him anxiously. Another scene, even more intense: the trap now momentarily empty, the same maggot, coming out to the threshold of his shop as if taking a break, looks vaguely around him, eyeing, in turn, in the crowd, the approach of a pale, hungry face, the eyes full of shame. That carpet of flesh which, even as I entered San Biagio dei Librai, had appeared extremely dense to me, seemed to disappear the deeper in I went, or at least it wasn't as extraordinary, much as a fresco when you move right up close to it. The fact remained that, as in Forcella, I had never before seen so many beings together, walking or hanging out, colliding and fleeing one another, greeting one another from their windows and calling out from the shops, bargaining over the price of goods, or yelling out a prayer, in the same sweet, broken, singers' voices that had more of the tone of a lament than that of the vaunted Neapolitan cheer. It was truly something that both astonished and eclipsed all one's thoughts. Most alarming was the number of children, a force sprung from the unconscious, who were not remotely supervised or fortunate, as could be observed from the black halo hanging over their heads. Every once in a while, like a rat, someone would emerge from a hole in the pavement, move a few steps out onto the sidewalk, and then scurry back in. The alleyways off this street, itself narrow and eroded, were even more narrow and eroded. I didn't see the sheets for which Naples is well known, only the black hollows in which they were once hung: windows, doors, balconies where tin cans sprouted withered bits of lemon verbena. I felt compelled to search, behind the miserable window-panes, for walls, and furnishings and perhaps other little windows opening onto a flowering garden at the back of the house; but you saw nothing except a confused tangle of various items such as blankets or remains of baskets, vases, and chairs from on which, like a sacred image blackened by time, the yellow cheekbones of a woman stuck out, her eyes unmoving, thoughtful, her black hair pinned on top of her head, her stick-like arms folded in her lap. At the far end of the alley, like a Persian rug worn down to clumps and threads, lay fragments of a great variety of garbage, out of the middle of which issued forth the pale, swollen, or bizarrely thin figures of more children, with large shaved heads and soft eyes. Few were clothed, and those who were wore shirts that exposed their stomachs; almost all were barefoot or wore sandals from another era, held together with string. Some played with tin cans; others, lying on the ground, were intent on covering their faces with dust, still others seemed to be busy building a little altar with a stone and a saint, and there were those who, gracefully imitating a priest, turned to offer their blessing.<br></p></p><h2>A 1950s Childhood: From Tin Baths to Bread and Dripping</h2><p>Do you remember Pathe News?

Of course, half the world is boycotting the Moscow Summer Olympic Games to protest the Soviet Union&#x2019;s recent invasion of Afghanistan, but that has made room for athletes from countries that are usually too small or underfunded to be competitive&#x2014;like Laos.<br><br>Ex-national coroner of Laos Dr. Siri Paiboun may be retired, but he and his wife, Madame Daeng, would do just about anything to have a chance to visit Moscow, so Siri finagles them a trip by getting them hired as medical advisers to the Olympians. Most of the athletes are young and innocent village people who have never worn running shoes, much less imagined anything as marvelous as the Moscow Olympic Village. As the competition heats up, however, Siri begins to suspect that one of the athletes is not who he says he is. Fearing a conspiracy, Siri and his friends investigate, liaising in secret with Inspector Phosy back home in Laos to see if the man might be an assassin. Siri&#x2019;s progress is derailed when a Lao Olympian is accused of murder. Now in the midst of a murky international incident, Dr. Siri must navigate not one but two paranoid government machines to make sure justice is done.</p><p>Colin Cotterill is the author of eleven other books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series: <i>The Coroner&#x2019;s Lunch</i>, <i>Thirty-Three Teeth</i>, <i>Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, <i>Slash and Burn</i>, <i>The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, <i>Six and a Half Deadly Sins</i> and <i>I Shot the Buddha</i>. His fiction has won a Dilys Award and a CWA Dagger in the Library. He lives in Chumphon, Thailand, with his wife and five deranged dogs.Comrade Noo looked awful but Siri&#x2019;s prognosis was positive.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everything seems to be in working order,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t have done anything Dtui didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The household clapped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So why doesn&#x2019;t he wake up?&#x201d; asked young Mee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl lived there with her mother and younger brother and several other squatters. It was hard to keep count. Siri and Daeng had turned their government allotted residence into something of a hostel for the homeless and helpless. It was a functioning commune embedded deep in a non-functioning communist state. Siri and Daeng themselves lived above their noodle shop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called a trauma,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;Sometimes, something so horrible happens that your mind can&#x2019;t take it anymore. It shuts up shop and puts a &#x2018;closed&#x2019; sign in the window. Comrade Noo is in there and his parts are recovering very slowly but his mind isn&#x2019;t ready to come out. I can&#x2019;t imagine what they did to him but he needs time every bit as much as he needs medicine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over some eleven bottles of Lao rice whisky and endless plates of pork <i>lahp </i>and spicy salad, the residents listened to Siri and Daeng&#x2019;s amazing adventures in Thailand. All the couple left out were tales of possession and s�ances and running battles with malevolent spirits, even though they were true. Just as there were bureaucratic layers of impossibility, so there were supernatural dimensions that rational educated people in the West would never believe to exist.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average Lao, brought up in a small community, had no doubts that there were spirits. They sought advice from them. They asked for forgiveness. Even the business people in the capital erected spirit houses to placate the ghosts. Many claimed to have seen the phantoms but few would have had the type of relationship Dr. Siri had developed. Despite his scientific training, Siri had been forced to concede that there were spirits. He would have preferred it to be otherwise but he was undeniably possessed by a thousand-year-old shaman by the name of Yeh Ming. The old Hmong had never made direct contact with Siri but had been a magnet for a menagerie of ghosts that had passed in and out of the doctor&#x2019;s life. This science-versus-supernatural dichotomy had fascinated and confounded him in equal measure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only recently had Siri learned the fundamentals of communication with the dead. Portents had shown that he would someday gain control over his innate abilities. But he was seventy-five&#x2014;a few months off seventy-six&#x2014;living in a population that barely made it past fifty. He was starting to wonder whether being dead would be such a bad thing. It would certainly simplify matters. What better way to communicate with spirits than to become one?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, his only functioning spirit guide was a boisterous transvestite fortune-teller by the name of Bpoo. They didn&#x2019;t get along. She was sarcastic and rude and even though she saw the future she kept it to herself. She was forever criticizing the doctor for his slow progress as a medium.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late, Siri&#x2019;s social circle had changed somewhat. He spent more time with shamans and healers. During an audience with a witch in the north, for example, he&#x2019;d made a dubious deal that affected both himself and Daeng. The woman produced elixirs that substituted one condition for another; the witch had replaced Madam Daeng&#x2019;s chronic rheumatism with a tail. This was an exchange Daeng was delighted with; Siri had no complaints. In fact he found her new appendage somewhat erotic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The witch&#x2019;s solution to Siri&#x2019;s problem, however&#x2014;that of his inability to talk to spirits&#x2014;was a little more complicated. And as a result of her elixir he had started to disappear from time to time. He found himself in places created in his own mind. Daeng would turn over in bed to find a warm but empty place beside her. Yet lately, when he was no longer in the same dimension as his wife, he had discovered portals to the other side. He learned that those who resided there believed that the other side was where Siri had come from. All very confusing even to the doctor and not at all helpful when it came to his hobby. Dr. Siri was in fact a most competent amateur detective and as such one should imagine that seeing spirit signs everywhere would be an invaluable asset. Yet only once had he been able to interpret their significance before the case&#x2019;s resolution. Invariably he was left to his own devices to solve mysteries in the old fashioned traditions of his hero, Inspector Maigret.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man studied the face of the young fellow sitting opposite. They were in one of those Chinese rooms cluttered with opulent furniture designed to make a visitor feel out of place and inferior. The chairs in which they sat were teak thrones with mother of pearl inlays that cut into the young man&#x2019;s backside every time he shifted his weight. The only sound was the hum of a hornet trying to find its way back out through the open window.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t just want him dead,&#x201d; said the old man.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No?&#x201d; said the youngster.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No. I want him so dead there&#x2019;s nothing to bury.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a problem.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told you have skills,&#x201d; said the old man. He leaned forward for his glass of cranberry tea. The young man nodded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As long as you can get me there,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do what needs to be done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course I can get you there. I just want to be certain the expense will be worth it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fail. And as you know I have my own reasons for doing this. It will be a shock for him to see me, assuming he remembers me. And a nasty end is the least I can offer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man smiled and sipped his tea.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Siri and Civilai were sitting on their log on the bank of the Mekhong eating baguettes that Civilai had baked himself. Since his retirement he&#x2019;d thrown his wife and their cook out of the kitchen and established a culinary occupation there. Thanks to the current d�tente with Thailand he&#x2019;d been able to stock up with ingredients. Today&#x2019;s baguettes contained processed ham with mustard to be washed down with one more bottle of Chardonnay. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugly the dog growled in his sleep at Siri&#x2019;s feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So, tell me,&#x201d; said Civilai. &#x201c;How on earth did your dog make it back from Thailand? I can&#x2019;t see him chasing the plane from Bangkok.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;m sure he could,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;But no. We&#x2019;d left him in Udon with a friend. Once we were sure we wouldn&#x2019;t be flogged in the dungeons below Chitlada Palace we phoned him&#x2014;the friend, not the dog. He drove Ugly to the river and launched him back home. He was waiting for us at the noodle shop when we got there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know most people would just get another dog,&#x201d; said Civilai. &#x201c;There are plenty of unpleasant looking strays to choose from.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;None like Ugly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri patted the dog&#x2019;s head and his tail stub thumped against the clay. The old friends ate and drank and looked across at Thailand. The river was running so low grasses had taken over the river bed and there was just a shred of water visible near the far bank. It all gave the false impression you could walk to Thailand. Unlike many great rivers, the mighty Mekhong had its humble moments.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s next?&#x201d; said Civilai. &#x201c;I imagine once you&#x2019;ve successfully scammed the junta f�hrer of Thailand there&#x2019;s nothing more to aspire to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;On the contrary,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;Daeng and I are thinking about gate-crashing the next Party Convention and nominating each other for seats on the politburo. The elderly can get away with anything. We&#x2019;re an untapped market. What about you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What menial duties has the committee lined up for you for the next few months?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri noticed a brief uncomfortable sideways glance before Civilai answered. It usually signaled that he was about to be lied to. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, nothing special,&#x201d; said Civilai.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about unspecial?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know. I might have to go to Moscow in a couple of months.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Trade delegation again?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Civilai?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I might . . . you know. The Olympics.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri got to his feet and adopted his most disdainful stare.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Olympics?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to Moscow for the Olympics and you thought it unnecessary to tell me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this? I&#x2019;m telling you now. We&#x2019;ve been so occupied listening to your Thai stories I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to mention it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think it could be of interest to me, Civilai? Little Laos gets invited to the Olympic Games for the first time in its history, a chance to mingle with the world&#x2019;s greatest athletes. You don&#x2019;t think your attendance at such an event might warrant a brief newsflash?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t really want to bring it up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I knew how you&#x2019;d react.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how have I reacted?&#x201d; Siri put his hands on his hips and puffed out his chest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve automatically decided you&#x2019;ll be coming with me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And what, may I ask, is so wrong with that? I&#x2019;m a qualified physician. Every sports team needs medical personnel. I was a highly placed university wrestler and boxer in my day. I have certificates. I&#x2019;m fluent in French and Vietnamese.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Games are in the Soviet Union,&#x201d; Civilai reminded him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware of that. They&#x2019;ll have interpreters, won&#x2019;t they? I can&#x2019;t believe you didn&#x2019;t recommend for me to go with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civilai looked away and blushed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;You did recommend me, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri, I . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What did they say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What did they say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They said they&#x2019;d sooner bring in a monkey than have you represent Laos at an international event. They think you&#x2019;re a liability. That you&#x2019;ll embarrass the Party.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri wobbled a little and sat back down on the log. &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s going as the team doctor?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not decided yet. They have a list. All the overseas qualified doctors at Mahosot with Party membership. Eight of them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Am I not even on the list?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re eighth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Behind Supasit the optician?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry. I&#x2019;ve requested to have Dtui in the team. She&#x2019;s a nurse and she speaks Russian. And I&#x2019;ve insisted there be at least two women in the party.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve insisted? So, what exactly is your role in all this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri, I . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Head of Mission.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re running the show and you can&#x2019;t even get me included?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s political. I don&#x2019;t really have much power.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yet there you are requesting team members. And you&#x2019;re not even a sportsman.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a diplomatic rather than a competitive mission, Siri. We don&#x2019;t have any athletes who stand a chance of competing at that level. It&#x2019;s a public relations campaign. The first time the Olympics will be held in a communist country. The Soviets have invited all their socialist allies to make an appearance. They&#x2019;re paying for the trip, equipment, uniforms. All we&#x2019;re lacking is ability.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;When does it start?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We go in June.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it a bit late to start putting a squad together?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been running competitions in schools and colleges since January. We have visiting Soviet coaches here as advisers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, well, that&#x2019;s all right then. We&#x2019;ll win medals for sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d be upset.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Upset? I won&#x2019;t be upset until the Aeroflot flight leaves Wattay without me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri, this is one you can&#x2019;t win. You&#x2019;ve antagonized everyone on the politburo. None of them likes you and if they find out what you got up to in Thailand . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes? What will they do? Throw me out of a fast-moving truck?&#x201d; He stood and put his half-eaten baguette on the log.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri, don&#x2019;t do anything stupid.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stupid is my middle name,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;And to be honest I&#x2019;m a little disappointed you didn&#x2019;t put up more of a fight on my behalf, Comrade VIP Head of Mission.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Siri was in a huff. He headed off along Mahosot Avenue with Ugly at his side.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s too much yeast in the baguettes,&#x201d; he shouted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Siri!&#x201d; Civilai called after him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Your sandals.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What about them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A month had passed since Siri learned of his exclusion from the Moscow Olympics. Comrade Noo was hanging on but an intravenous drip was a poor substitute for actual food. His wounds refused to heal and his body lost mass every day. The doctor could find no physical reasons for the monk&#x2019;s decline. It was as if he&#x2019;d aba...</p><h2>Kingdom Come: How Jesus Wants to Change the World</h2><p>God is up to something! And his plans are far greater than you might imagine. Christianity is not merely about isolated individuals going to heaven. It&#39;s about God transforming the entire world and making things right. Sicknesses will be healed, sins will be forgiven, injustice will be eradicated, and all creation will be redeemed. But this is not merely a distant future. It&#39;s happening now through what Jesus came to establish--the kingdom of God. Allen Wakabayashi reawakens you to the world-changing reality of the kingdom of God. With clear, biblical insight, he unpacks what Jesus proclaimed about the good news of the kingdom and spells out the implications for you today. Focusing on the kingdom of God will revolutionize how you live out your faith, how you think about your world and how you explain the good news about Jesus. Ultimately, understanding yourself as a citizen of the kingdom will empower you to be one of God&#39;s change agents in the world. God is at work to restore everything to be the way he intended it to be, and you can be a part of what he is doing! Get a glimpse of the kingdom coming, and experience his will being done--on earth as it is in heaven.</p><p>Allen M. Wakabayashi has served on various campuses with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Currently, he serves at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and he previously served at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He is the author of <em>Kingdom Come</em>."Though it is a central assertion of the New Testament and the storm center of much serious historical and theological scholarship, the claim that with Jesus the kingdom of God has been inaugurated has still too little captured the popular imagination of Christians. Instead, far too often 'kingdom of God' language serves as a kind of code for various agendas only partially overlapping with the grand vision standing at the center of the New Testament witness. Allen Wakabayashi, himself well apprised of the scholarly discussion, has performed a tremendous service by exploring the revolutionary implications of this crucial theme for the way we carry on our lives and our mission as followers of Jesus. This is an engaging, hopeful and refreshingly honest guide to life in the already-and-not-yet reign of God." (Garwood P. Anderson, Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary, Orlando)<br><br>"Allen Wakabayashi makes the case that God's kingdom has come and signs of it are everywhere. We often miss it, though, because it is too radical, full of sacrifice and delight. Allen wants you to see the signs, take up your cross and join the parade." (Alec Hill, President, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA)<br><br><em>"Kingdom Come</em> is a welcome challenge to believers awaiting the consummation of the kingdom in its fullness to be shaping present society according to God-honoring kingdom principles. The Westminster Confession has taught us that the chief end of man is to glorify God; Wakabayashi reminds us that the chief end of the kingdom itself is the glory of God. Unsatisfied with pie-in-the-sky escapism, Wakabayashi calls the evangelical community to fulfill its role as salt and light, pursuing justice, righteousness--even the glory of God--in all aspects of life in a fallen world." (Richard M. Weber, Assistant Professor of Theology, Moody Bible Institute)<br><br>"Confronting the pervasive individualism of our culture, Allen Wakabayashi calls us to work out the implications of God's kingdom for our lives, communities and mission into the world. His commitment to see God change the world, and especially the university world, is contagious." (Rick Richardson, national evangelist with IVCF and author of Evangelism Outside the Box)<br><br>"Reading <em>Kingdom Come</em> was an invigorating reminder that the Bride of Christ has plenty to do to get ready for the wedding! And plenty to think about too. This book is an all-too-rare place where ministry and scholarship serve each other not only well, but with joy!" (Robbie F. Castleman, Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies and Theology, John Brown University)</p><h2>Allegheny Front (Mary McCarthy Prize in Short Fiction)</h2><p><p>Set in the author's homeland of West Virginia, this panoramic collection of stories traces the people and animals who live in precarious balance in the mountains of Appalachia over a span of two hundred years, in a disappearing rural world.

As importantly, it looks at the causes of obesity, obesity-related problems and standard treatments. All the risks and benefits associated with the surgery are examined, including recovery, potential long-term problems and risks, and measures of success. </p><p> Because diet, portion size and lifestyle are integral to ensuring a successful surgical outcome, the second component of the book provides the resources for healthy eating, nutrition, supplements and making positive changes in lifestyle. To further ensure success, 150 recipes have been included that have been specially created with weight-loss patients in mind. Not only are they delicious, but they are nutritionally sound and designed to accommodate the techniques and diet stages required after surgery. </p><p> This book is ideal for anyone considering weight loss surgery, who has had the surgery or who is looking for a dietary and lifestyle program/strategies that have been created specifically to meet these unique requirements. </p></p><p><p><b>Sue Ekserci</b>, BASc, RD, has worked at Humber River Regional Hospital in several areas of dietetics, including medicine, pediatrics and prenatal, and she is currently a dietitian in the hospital's outpatient bariatric program.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Laz Klein</b>, MD, MSc, FRCS(C), is a staff surgeon at Humber River Regional Hospital in Toronto, where he converted the existing bariatric program from "open" to "laparoscopic," and he is an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto.</p></p><h2>Constantinople: City of the World&#39;s Desire, 1453 1924</h2><p>Wedding&nbsp;elegant prose with&nbsp;impeccable historical research, this highly acclaimed history absorbingly charts the interaction between the vibrantly cosmopolitan capital of Constantinople the city of the world's desire and its ruling family. In 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror entered Constantinople on a white horse, beginning an Ottoman love affair with the city that lasted until 1924, when the last Caliph hurriedly left on the Orient Express. For almost five centuries Constantinople, with its enormous racial and cultural diversity, was the center of the dramatic and often depraved story of an extraordinary dynasty. This is the definitive history of&nbsp;one of the world&#x2019;s most exotic and&nbsp;exciting cities.</p><p>Philip Mandsel&#39;s book is a five-hundred-year history of Constantinople (now Istanbul) which attempts to convey the rich history of this one-time capital city and describe the defining characteristics which point toward its potential to return to global grandeur. The book is sizable in scope and weight: there&#39;s a wealth of details and illustrations. Mandsel addresses the development of Constantinople into an Islamic city, covering the five-century dynasty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine Empire in 1453, converting the city from the capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the home of sultans, eunuchs, and janizaries. They created a city of mosques and minarets that served as the Ottoman capital until the end of World War I. Mandsel&#39;s attention falls particularly on the palaces and the political history of the capital, as well as the great architectural works which still constitute the city&#39;s skyline. This is a highly readable history of the great city on the Bosporus, marked by keen perceptions of art and palace life.<b>Philip Mansel</b> is the author of <i>Dressed to Rule</i>, <i>Louis XVIII</i>, <i>Paris Between Empires</i>, and <i>Prince of Europe</i>.

This great German Lutheran mystic and follower of Melanchthon aroused Calvinist hostility by his spirituality of Christ in the heart of man. He was deposed as pastor of Bedeborn for refusing to abide by the orders of his Calvinist duke. Inspired by Bernard of Clairvaux, Angela of Foligno, John Tauler and Thomas a Kempis, he later came to be venerated by the Pietists. <p>True Christianity is his principal mystical work and one of the most important in the Protestant tradition. He published the first book of this work, which is presented here, in 1605. He added three other books at a later date and two more were appended posthumously.

First staged at the dawn of the region&#39;s stride toward nationalism and independence, it heralded a new era of Jamaican and Caribbean drama, one unafraid of taking a serious look at the people, the culture, and the language. The play was the first to seriously deal with Jamaican Creole and the Jamaican religious form of Pocomania. Though London Calling features citizens from a fictional country, the play explores the all too real anxieties surrounding race, class, identity and migration in early twentieth century London. These plays grapple with class, race, gender, language and culture as they explore the tensions at the nexus of prejudice and the performance of blackness.</p><p></p><h2>Build, Beaver, Build!: Life at the Longest Beaver Dam</h2><p><p>The first year of a beaver kit's life is full of new discoveries and dangers. But the most important lesson the kit learns is how to take care of his family's home. The lodge where he lives is protected by a long dam that many beavers have worked to build over the years. As the kit grows up, he helps repair and add to the family dam&#x2015;and begins to build a life for himself. <br> <br> Set at what is believed to be the world's longest beaver dam, <em>Build, Beaver, Build</em>&#x2015;by award-winning author Sandra Markle&#x2015;provides a glimpse of beaver life, seen through the eyes of one young beaver and his family.</p></p><p><p><strong>Sandra Markle</strong> is the author of numerous award-winning books for children.

Her heart lies in forest exploration, mountain lake swimming, and bramble fort building. <em>Build, Beaver, Build!</em> is her first picture book.</p><p>"One June night, a 'softball-sized' beaver kit is swimming across the pond to his mother when an owl swoops down toward him. The three-week-old kit dives, paddling underwater into the entrance tunnel to his family's lodge. As he and his sisters grow up, they learn to gather sticks, repair the lodge and dam, defend themselves against predators, and add to the family's winter food supply, stored near the lodge entrances. The following spring, they become 'babysitters in training' as well as dam builders, preparing them to raise their own families someday. A nip from a Canada goose and a narrow escape from a coyote add additional drama to the young beaver's story, but the information in Markle's simply written text is pretty engaging in itself. <strong>Nicely composed,</strong> the<strong> lively illustrations</strong> include many night scenes. One very effective picture shows a cross-section of the beaver lodge, its upper part covered with snow and its lower part submerged in water, with the kit emerging from the tunnel into the pond. <strong>A satisfying picture book for junior naturalists.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist Online</em></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>An exciting introduction to these semiaquatic animals</strong>. Readers follow a young beaver kit over the course of a year as he and his family find food, ward off predators, and continue to build their dam and lodge. Short paragraphs lend themselves to being read aloud, and the narrative will hold kids' attention. However, the details and vocabulary found in other animal texts are lacking here; report writers will need to look elsewhere for general facts. <strong>Hocking's intricate and beautiful full-spread watercolors greatly enhance the text.</strong> VERDICT: <strong>A solid supplemental purchase.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>School Library Journal </em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Urban Revolution</h2><p>Originally published in 1970, The Urban Revolution marked Henri Lefebvre&#x2019;s first sustained critique of urban society, a work in which he pioneered the use of semiotic, structuralist, and poststructuralist methodologies in analyzing the development of the urban environment. Although it is widely considered a foundational book in contemporary thinking about the city, The Urban Revolution has never been translated into English&#x2014;until now. This first English edition, deftly translated by Robert Bononno, makes available to a broad audience Lefebvre&#x2019;s sophisticated insights into the urban dimensions of modern life.Lefebvre begins with the premise that the total urbanization of society is an inevitable process that demands of its critics new interpretive and perceptual approaches that recognize the urban as a complex field of inquiry. Dismissive of cold, modernist visions of the city, particularly those embodied by rationalist architects and urban planners like Le Corbusier, Lefebvre instead articulates the lived experiences of individual inhabitants of the city. In contrast to the ideology of urbanism and its reliance on commodification and bureaucratization&#x2014;the capitalist logic of market and state&#x2014;Lefebvre conceives of an urban utopia characterized by self-determination, individual creativity, and authentic social relationships.A brilliantly conceived and theoretically rigorous investigation into the realities and possibilities of urban space, The Urban Revolution remains an essential analysis of and guide to the nature of the city.Henri Lefebvre (d. 1991) was one of the most significant European thinkers of the twentieth century. His many books include The Production of Space (1991), Everyday Life in the Modern World (1994), Introduction to Modernity (1995), and Writings on Cities (1995).Robert Bononno is a full-time translator who lives in New York.

He&#x2019;s got the seat of my Benz pushed all the way back and his feet up on the dash, the heels of his pointy black shoes scratching the plastic. With his hair slicked back and his mirrored sunglasses covering his eyes, he looks like a study in villainy.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s actually a junior federal agent, still in training, sure, but with a key card and an ID badge and everything.<br> <br>To be fair, he&#x2019;s also a villain.<br> <br>I tap my gloved fingers impatiently against the curve of the wheel and bring a pair of binoculars to my eyes for about the millionth time. All I see is a boarded-up building on the wrong side of Queens. &#x201c;What is she doing in there? It&#x2019;s been forty minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; he asks me. &#x201c;Bad things. That&#x2019;s her after-school job now. Taking care of shady business so Zacharov&#x2019;s gloves stay clean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her dad won&#x2019;t put her in any real danger,&#x201d; I say, but the tone of my voice makes it pretty obvious I&#x2019;m trying to convince myself more than I&#x2019;m trying to convince my brother.<br> <br>Barron snorts. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a new soldier. Got to prove herself. Zacharov couldn&#x2019;t keep her out of danger if he tried&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s not going to be trying real hard. The other laborers are watching, waiting for her to be weak. Waiting for her to screw up. He knows that. So should you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I think of her at twelve, a skinny girl with eyes too large for her face and a nimbus of tangled blond hair. In my memory she&#x2019;s sitting on the branch of a tree, eating a rope of red licorice. Her lips are sticky with it. Her flip-flops are hanging off her toes. She&#x2019;s cutting her initials into the bark, high up, so her cousin can&#x2019;t claim she&#x2019;s lying when she tells him she got higher than he ever will.<br> <br>Boys never believe I can beat them, she told me back then. But I always win in the end.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe she spotted the car and went out the back,&#x201d; I say finally.<br> <br>&#x201c;No way she made us.&#x201d; He sucks on the straw again. It makes that rattling empty-cup sound, echoing through the car. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re like ninjas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s cocky,&#x201d; I say. After all, tailing someone isn&#x2019;t easy, and Barron and I aren&#x2019;t that good at it yet, no matter what he says. My handler at the agency, Yulikova, has been encouraging me to shadow Barron, so I can learn secondhand and can keep myself safe until she figures out how to tell her bosses that she&#x2019;s got hold of a teenage transformation worker with a bad attitude and a criminal record. And since Yulikova&#x2019;s in charge, Barron&#x2019;s stuck teaching me. It&#x2019;s supposed to be just for a few months, until I graduate from Wallingford. Let&#x2019;s see if we can stand each other that long.<br> <br>Of course, I&#x2019;m pretty sure this isn&#x2019;t the kind of lesson Yulikova&#x2019;s been imagining.<br> <br>Barron grins, white teeth flashing like dropped dice. &#x201c;What do you think Lila Zacharov would do if she knew you were tailing her?&#x201d;<br> <br>I grin back. &#x201c;Probably she&#x2019;d kill me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods. &#x201c;Probably she would. Probably she&#x2019;d kill me twice for helping you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably you deserve it,&#x201d; I say. He snorts.<br> <br>Over the last few months I got every last thing I ever wanted&#x2014;and then I threw it all away. Everything I thought I could never have was offered up on a silver platter&#x2014;the girl, the power, a job at the right hand of Zacharov, the most formidable man I know. It wouldn&#x2019;t even have been that hard to work for him. It probably would have been fun. And if I didn&#x2019;t care who I hurt, it would still all be mine.<br> <br>I lift the binoculars and study the door again&#x2014;the worn paint striping the boards and crumbling like bread crumbs, the chewed-up bottom edge as ragged as if it had been gnawed on by rats.<br> <br>Lila would still be mine.<br> <br>Mine. The language of love is like that, possessive. That should be the first warning that it&#x2019;s not going to encourage anyone&#x2019;s betterment.<br> <br>Barron groans and throws his cup into the backseat. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe that you blackmailed me into becoming Johnny Law and now I have to sweat it out five days a week with the other recruits while you use my experience to stalk your girlfriend. How is that fair?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One, I think you mean the extremely dubious benefit of your experience. Two, Lila&#x2019;s not my girlfriend. Three, I just wanted to make sure she was okay.&#x201d; I count off these points on my leather-covered fingers. &#x201c;And four, the last thing you should want is fairness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stalk her at school,&#x201d; Barron says, ignoring everything I&#x2019;ve just said. &#x201c;Come on. I have to make a phone call. Let&#x2019;s pack in this lesson and get a couple of slices. I&#x2019;ll even buy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sigh. The car is stuffy and smells like old coffee. I&#x2019;d like to stretch my legs. And Barron is probably right&#x2014;we should give this up. Not for the reason he&#x2019;s saying but for the one that&#x2019;s implied. The one about it not being okay to lurk around outside buildings, spying on girls you like.<br> <br>My fingers are reaching reluctantly for my keys when she walks out of the worn door, as though my giving up summoned her. She&#x2019;s got on tall black riding boots and a steel gray trench. I study the quicksilver gestures of her gloved hands, the sway of her earrings, the slap of her heels on the steps, and the lash of her hair. She&#x2019;s so beautiful, I can barely breathe. Behind her follows a boy with his hair braided into the shape of two antelope horns. His skin is darker than mine. He&#x2019;s got on baggy jeans and a hoodie. He&#x2019;s shoving a folded-up wad of something that looks like cash into an inside pocket.<br> <br>Outside of school Lila doesn&#x2019;t bother wearing a scarf. I can see the grim necklace of marks on her throat, scars black where ash was rubbed into them. That&#x2019;s part of the ceremony when you join her father&#x2019;s crime family, slicing your skin and swearing that you&#x2019;re dead to your old life and reborn into wickedness. Not even Zacharov&#x2019;s daughter was spared it.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s one of them now. No turning back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, now,&#x201d; says Barron, gleeful. &#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;re thinking we just observed the end of a very naughty transaction. But let&#x2019;s consider the possibility that actually we caught her doing something totally innocent yet embarrassing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look at him absently. &#x201c;Embarrassing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like meeting up to play one of those card games where you have to collect everything. Pok�mon. Magic the Gathering. Maybe they&#x2019;re training for a tournament. With all that money she just handed him, I&#x2019;m guessing he won.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s tutoring her in Latin. Or they were painting miniatures together. Or he&#x2019;s teaching her shadow puppetry.&#x201d; He makes a duck-like gesture with one gloved hand.<br> <br>I punch Barron&#x2019;s shoulder, but not really hard. Just hard enough to make him shut up. He laughs and adjusts his sunglasses, pushing them higher on his nose.<br> <br>The boy with the braids crosses the street, head down, hood pulled up to shadow his face. Lila walks to the corner and raises her hand to hail a cab. The wind whips at her hair, making it a nimbus of blown gold.<br> <br>I wonder if she&#x2019;s done her homework for Monday.<br> <br>I wonder if she could ever love me again.<br> <br>I wonder just how mad she&#x2019;d be if she knew I was here, watching her. Probably really, really mad.<br> <br>Cold October air floods into the car suddenly, tossing around the empty cup in the backseat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Barron says, leaning on the door, grinning down at me. I didn&#x2019;t even notice him getting out. &#x201c;Grab some quarters for the meter, and your stuff.&#x201d; He jerks his head in the direction of the boy with the braids. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to follow him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about that phone call?&#x201d; I shiver in my thin green T-shirt. My leather jacket is wadded up in the backseat of my car. I reach for it and shrug it on.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was bored,&#x201d; Barron says. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br> <br>This morning when he told me we were going to practice tailing people, I picked Lila as my target half as a joke, half out of sick desire. I didn&#x2019;t think that Barron would agree. I didn&#x2019;t think that we&#x2019;d actually see her leaving her apartment building and getting into a town car. I for sure didn&#x2019;t think that I would wind up here, close to actually finding out what she&#x2019;s been doing when she&#x2019;s not in school.<br> <br>I get out of the car and slam the door behind me.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the problem with temptation. It&#x2019;s so damn tempting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Feels almost like real agent work, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Barron says as we walk down the street, heads bowed against the wind. &#x201c;You know, if we caught your girlfriend committing a crime, I bet Yulikova would give us a bonus or something for being prize pupils.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except that we&#x2019;re not going to do that,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you wanted us to be good guys.&#x201d; He grins a too-wide grin. He&#x2019;s enjoying needling me, and my reacting only makes it worse, but I can&#x2019;t stop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not if it means hurting her,&#x201d; I say, my voice as deadly as I can make it. &#x201c;Never her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it. Hurting, bad. But how do you excuse stalking her and her friends, little brother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not excusing it,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just doing it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Following&#x2014;stalking&#x2014;someone isn&#x2019;t easy. You try not to stare too hard at the back of his head, keep your distance, and act like you&#x2019;re just another person freezing your ass off in late October on the streets of Queens. Above all you try not to seem like a badly trained federal agent wannabe.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop worrying,&#x201d; Barron says, strolling along beside me. &#x201c;Even if we get made, this guy will probably be flattered. He&#x2019;d think he was moving up in the world if he had a government tail.&#x201d;<br> <br>Barron is better at acting casual than I am. I guess he should be. He&#x2019;s got nothing to lose if we&#x2019;re spotted. Lila couldn&#x2019;t possibly hate him more than she does. Plus, he probably trains for this all day, while I&#x2019;m at Wallingford studying to get into the kind of college there is no way I am ever going to attend.<br> <br>It still annoys me. Since I was a kid, we&#x2019;ve competed over lots of things. Mostly, all those competitions were ones I lost.<br> <br>We were the two youngest, and when Philip would be off with his friends on the weekends, Barron and I would be stuck doing whatever errands Dad needed doing, or practicing whatever skill he thought we needed to learn.<br> <br>He particularly wanted us to be better at pickpocketing and lock-picking than we were.<br> <br>Two kids are the perfect pickpocket team, he&#x2019;d say. One to do the lift, the other one to distract or to take the handoff.<br> <br>We both practiced dips. First identifying where Dad kept his wallet by looking for a bulge in a back pocket or the way one side of his coat swung heavily because something was inside. Then the lift. I was pretty good; Barron was better.<br> <br>Then we practiced distraction. Crying. Asking for directions. Giving the mark a quarter that you claim they dropped.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like stage magic, Dad said. You&#x2019;ve got to make me look over there so I won&#x2019;t notice what&#x2019;s happening right in front of my face.<br> <br>When Dad didn&#x2019;t feel like fending off our clumsy attempts at lifts, he&#x2019;d bring us to the barn and show us his collection: He had an old metal tackle box with locks on all the sides, so you had to run the gauntlet of seven different locks to get into it. Neither Barron nor I ever managed.<br> <br>Once we learned how to open a lock with a tool, we&#x2019;d have to learn to pick it with a bobby pin, with a hanger, then with a stick or some other found object. I kept hoping that I&#x2019;d be naturally great at locks, since I was pretty sure I wasn&#x2019;t a worker back then, and since I already felt like an outsider in my family. I thought that if there was one thing I was better at than all of them, that would make up for everything else.<br> <br>It sucks to be the youngest.<br> <br>If you get into the supersecure box, we&#x2019;ll sneak into the movie of your choice, Dad would say. Or, I put candy in there. Or, If you really want that video game, just open the box and I&#x2019;ll get it for you. But it didn&#x2019;t matter what he promised. What did matter was that I only ever managed to pick three locks; Barron managed five.<br> <br>And here we are again, learning a bunch of new skills. I can&#x2019;t help feeling a little bit competitive and a little bit disappointed in myself that I&#x2019;m already so far behind. After all, Yulikova thinks Barron has a real future with the Bureau. She told me so. I told her that sociopaths are relentlessly charming.<br> <br>I think she figured I was joking.<br> <br>&#x201c;What other stuff do they teach you at federal agent school?&#x201d; I ask. It shouldn&#x2019;t bother me that he&#x2019;s fitting in so well. So what if he&#x2019;s faking it? Good for him.<br> <br>I guess what bothers me is him faking it better than I am.<br> <br>He rolls his eyes. &#x201c;Nothing much. Obvious stuff&#x2014;getting people to trust you with mirroring behavior. You know, doing whatever the other person&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d; He laughs. &#x201c;Honestly, undercover&#x2019;s just like being a con man. Same techniques. Identify the target. Befriend. Then betray.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mirroring behavior. When a mark takes a drink from his water glass, so should you. When he smiles, so should you. Keep it subtle, rather than creepy, and it&#x2019;s a good technique.<br> <br>Mom taught it to me when I was ten. Cassel, she said, you want to know how to be the most charming guy anyone&#x2019;s ever met? Remind them of their favorite person. Everyone&#x2019;s favorite person is their own damn self.<br> <br>&#x201c;Except now you&#x2019;re the good guy,&#x201d; I say, and laugh.<br> <br>He laughs too, like I just told the best joke in the world.<br> <br>But now that I&#x2019;m thinking about Mom, I can&#x2019;t help worrying about her. She&#x2019;s been missing since she got caught using her worker talent&#x2014;emotion&#x2014;to manipulate Governor Patton, a guy who hated curse workers to begin with and now is on national news every night with a vein popping out of his forehead, calling for her blood. I hope she stays hidden. I just wish I knew where she was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Barron,&#x201d; I say, about to start up a conversation we&#x2019;ve already had about a million times, the one where we tell each other that she&#x2019;s fine and she&#x2019;ll contact us soon. &#x201c;Do you think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Up ahead the boy with the braids steps into a pool hall.<br> <br>&#x201c;In here,&#x201d; Barron says, with a jerk of his head. We duck into a deli across the street. I&#x2019;m grateful for the warmth. Barron orders us two coffees, and we stand near the window, waiting.<br> <br>&#x201c;You ever going to get over this thing with Lila?&#x201d; he asks me, breaking the silence, making me wish I&#x2019;d been the one to do it, so that I could have picked another subject. Any other subject. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like some kind of illness with you. How long have you been into her? Since you were what, eleven?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t say anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you really wanted to follow her and her new hire, right? Because you don&#x2019;t think that you&#x2019;re worthy of her, but you&#x2019;re hoping that if she does something awful enough, maybe you&#x2019;ll deserve each other after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how it works,&#x201d; I say, under my breath. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how love works.&#x201d;<br> <br>He snorts. &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>I bite my tongue, swallowing every obnoxious taunt that comes into my mind. If he doesn&#x2019;t get a rise out of me, maybe he&#x2019;ll stop, and then maybe I can distract him. We stand like that for several minutes, until he sighs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bored again. I&#x2019;m going to make that phone call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What if he comes out?&#x201d; I ask, annoyed. &#x201c;How am I going to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He widens his eyes in mock distress. &#x201c;Improvise.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bell rings as he steps out the door, and the guy at the counter shouts his customary &#x201c;Thanksforcomingcomeagain.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the sidewalk in front of the deli, Barron is flirting like crazy as he paces back and forth, dropping the names of French restaurants like he eats off a tablecloth every night. He&#x2019;s got his phone cradled against ...</p><h2>The Coming of the Unicorn: Scottish Folk Tales for Children (Kelpies)</h2><p><p><em>'Stories are something you carry with you, something to last your entire life, to be passed on to your children, and their children for evermore.'</em><br>Duncan Williamson</p> <p>Duncan Williamson came from a family of Traveling People, who told stories around the campfire for entertainment and for teaching. As a child, Duncan learnt the ways of the world through stories: 'My father's knowledge told us how to live in this world as natural human beings -- not to be greedy, not to be foolish, not to be daft or selfish -- by stories.'</p> <p>In this collection, he passes on some of these wonderful children's folk and fairy tales. For over sixty years Duncan traveled around Scotland -- on foot, then in a horse and cart, and later an old van -- collecting tales, which not only come from the Traveling People but from the crofters, farmers and shepherds he met along the way.</p> <p>This collection includes tales about cunning foxes and storytelling cats, hunchbacked ogres and beautiful unicorns, helpful broonies and mysterious fairies, rich kings and fearsome warriors, as well as those about ordinary folk trying to make their way in the world. The stories have been written down as faithfully as possible to Duncan's unique storytelling voice, full of color, humor and life.</p></p><p>Duncan Williamson was born in 1928 on the shores of Loch Fyne. He was the seventh of sixteen children born to a family of Travellers, who set up camp in the same place every winter and wandered the Highlands during the summer, hawking their tin and natural willow wares. Duncan left home at the age of fifteen and spent the next forty years travelling, continuing the traditional trades of his people. In 1980 he moved into a farm cottage in Fife with his second wife, Linda, who transcribed some of his vast repertoire of songs, stories and family history. Duncan died in 2007, leaving behind a worldwide legacy. His reputation was extraordinary and the impact of his storytelling continues in literary editions of his work, published by Canongate, Cambridge University Press, Penguin, Mondadori, and more recently Birlinn, Luath Press and Floris Books. Linda Williamson was born in Madison, Wisconsin in 1949. She has a PhD from Edinburgh University, and is an American folklorist, storyteller and editor.

This title helps you gain inspirational tips for living life to the fullest by listening to the author live as he explores the secrets of the power of intention.</p><p>After years of spiritual study and reflection, inspirational speaker and bestselling author Wayne Dyer has emerged a highly esteemed teacher. His current message about tapping into the power of intention may sound like good old positive thinking: just stay focused on what you want, rather than focusing on the lack of having what you want. But the teaching here goes deeper than just controlling thoughts (although he does acknowledge that thought control is a surprisingly challenging and significant endeavor). This book might help readers land a better job, but it's more relevant for those who are ready to detach from an ego-driven life filled with quick fixes of happiness and step into a more authentic, joyful, and spiritually fulfilling life. His core teachings speak to tapping into a universal source of energy that can also be called the "power of intention." He calls people who are consciously co-creating with this energy source "connectors" and describes them as "individuals who have made themselves available for success...They don't say <i>With my luck things won't work out.</i> Instead, you&#x2019;re more likely to hear something like, <i>I intend to create this and I know it will work out</i>." Connectors are also committed to Dyer's "seven faces of intention"--creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance and receptivity, which he speaks to throughout the book. Each chapter concludes with five suggestions for becoming stronger connectors, such as how to monitor one's inner speech or shift out of low-energy beliefs. Some criticize Dyer for not giving credit to other teachers who offer this same message, especially Jerry and Esther Hicks (<i>A New Beginning I</i>) and even Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's impossible to know whether this was a deliberate omission, but it is obvious that Dyer has tapped into a growing conversation about co-creating with "source." Other leading-edge voices in this conversation include Eckhart Tolle (<i>The Power of Now</i>), Shakti Gawain (<i>Creative Visualization</i> ) and Lynn Grabhorn (<i>Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting</i>). --<i>Gail Hudson</i>$500K advertising budget!

She deals with the usual drugs and alcohol (and their celebrities: Freud's cocaine, Baudelaire's hashish, the Victorians' laudanum), and moves beyond them to addictions that are culturally accepted--an insatiable appetite for romance novels, for instance, and romance itself.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a commonplace of modern culture to presume that there is a subculture or counterculture deeply saturated with drugs, but such modern cultures need subcultures, and need drugs on every level. Culture defines itself, its classes, its power structures, and its economy in terms of how it allows and encourages drugs to circulate. If drugs are dangerous, that danger seems to increase their appeal for millions. If drugs are unnatural and addictive, gasoline is a drug. What is art but a kind of drug, and what is art criticism but a kind of criticism of drugs and drug-induced states?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Gustave Flaubert's <i>Madame Bovary</i> takes up the problems of drugs and addiction in numerous ways, which Ronnell unpacks and presents as examples of the safe and unsafe. From Emma Bovary's romantic hallucinations to her suicide by arsenic, she moves through this realistic novel constantly reaching for the unreal. For Ronell, Emma Bovary represents the first addict, embodying a yearning that calls from the bottom of her humanity, and which it seems can only be satisfied by some sort of drug.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Avital Ronell</b> is a professor of German at New York University.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is author of <i>Dictations:&nbsp; On Haunted Writing, The Telephone Book, Finitude's Score,</i> and <i>Stupidity.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her essays have appeared in <i>Diacritics, Differences, Genre, Modern Language Notes, Stanford Italian Review, Studies in Twentieth Century Literature, Substance,</i> and many other journals.<br> &nbsp;&#34;At the center of Crack Wars is Ronell&#39;s constitutive reading of Madame Bovary, that &#39;clinic of phantasms, &#39; the urtext of toxic modernity.&#34;</p><h2>A Wideness in God&#39;s Mercy: The Finality Of Jesus Christ In A World Of Religions</h2><p><p>Here is a ground-breaking book that suggests some new possibilities of interpretation around the challenge of religious pluralism. The subject of the book is the finality of Jesus Christ in a world of different religions. Pinnock explains succinctly the factors that have made religious pluralism a major challenge for Christian theology. Then he places the issue in the history of doctrine leading up to the present day. Five chapters follow this introductory material and cover the field very systematically: The first chapter deals with God's global reach in salvation and shows that God is concerned for all people in all nations; chapter two highlights the Christology through which God is known to be the God of grace; the third chapter shows how the Bible views other religions as they presently exist and how we can understand them; chapter four deals with religions as non-static entities and the object of divine power bringing in the kingdom; and the fifth chapter discusses eschatology, or how it is possible to understand salvation in generous and large terms. A Wideness in God's Mercy is one of the very few books to present a strong proposal on the issue of religious pluralism while maintaining a rock-solid evangelical stance. It will no doubt launch a decade of discussion on a higher level among Christians.</p></p><p><p>Clark H.

Ellis, as no one else can, illuminates the iconic impact of Physeter macrocephalus ("big-headed blower") on our history, environment, and culture, with a substantial nod to Herman Melville and <i>Moby-Dick</i>, the great novel that put the sperm whale (and whaling) on the literary map.<br><br>Ranging far and wide, Ellis covers the sperm whale's evolution, ecology, biology, anatomy, behavior, social organization, intelligence, communications, migrations, diet, and breeding. He also devotes considerable space to the whale's hunting prowess, including its clashes with the giant squid, and to the history of the whaling industry that decimated its numbers during the last two centuries. He even includes a story about a beached juvenile he helped rescue, an event that provided scientists with one of their first opportunities to observe a sperm whale in the water and up close.<br><br>Offering a rich tapestry for anyone with an interest in the marvels of ocean life, Ellis's book provides an indispensable guide to the life and times of one of the planet's most intelligent, elusive, and endangered species.</p><p>"The most mysterious of all mammals is richly chronicled in this mesmerizing voyage that includes battles with whaleboats and giant squid.

Standout projects include whimsical paper-airplane earrings, a Liberty-esque floral-print earring and necklace set, and several minimalist pendant projects that resemble glass, rather than shrink plastic.

The genre of &#39;citizen tragedy&#39; came into its own in the eighteenth century, but Middleton can claim to have created it: Bianca, wife of a middling commercial agent, arouses the lust of the Duke of Florence and becomes his mistress, first secretly, then openly and finally, after her husband has been seduced by the scheming Lady Livia and stabbed by Livia&#39;s brother, the Duke&#39;s wife. Livia plots her revenge, and the play ends with a banquet and a masque that are a triumph of black farce. Middleton&#39;s powerful, psychologically complex female characters and his clear-sighted analysis of misogyny are bound to impress today&#39;s audiences, but it is the pervasive irony - cynicism, even - with which he dissects the motivations of both oppressor and victim that makes him so eerily modern.</p><p><b>William C.

American politics has lost its civic voice, leaving both liberals and conservatives unable to inspire the sense of community and civic engagement that self-government requires.</p><p>In search of a public philosophy adequate to our time, Sandel ranges across the American political experience, recalling the arguments of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and Douglas, Holmes and Brandeis, FDR and Reagan. He relates epic debates over slavery and industrial capitalism to contemporary controversies over the welfare state, religion, abortion, gay rights, and hate speech. <i>Democracy's Discontent</i> provides a new interpretation of the American political and constitutional tradition that offers hope of rejuvenating our civic life.</p></p><p>Michael Sandel has written an important book about the meaning of liberty. Sandel argues that over the last century, Americans have abandoned an earlier communitarian view of liberty, rooted in participation in self-government, for a narrower, individualistic definition, based on the power of personal choice. That has led to the great paradox of American politics: Just as Americans have become freer in the conduct of their personal lives, they have become more constrained in their public lives. The strength of Sandel&#39;s book is his account of how this definition of liberty has changed over the last 200 years. He argues persuasively that the new definition reinforces undesirable trends in court decisions and public policy Sandel argues brilliantly that the change in this definition of liberty took place after the Civil War and was based primarily on economic change. His analysis is superb. By revealing the shallowness of liberal and conservative views of democracy, [this book] inspires us to reevaluate what American politics is really about.Despite the success of American life in the last half-century - unprecedented affluence, greater social justice for women and minorities, the end of the Cold War - our politics is rife with discontent. Americans are frustrated with government. We fear we are losing control of the forces that govern our lives, and that the moral fabric of community - from neighborhood to nation - is unraveling around us. What ails democracy in America today, and what can be done about it? Democracy&#39;s Discontent traces our political predicament to a defect in the public philosophy by which we live. In a searching account of current controversies over the role of government, the scope of rights and entitlements, and the place of morality in politics, Michael Sandel identifies the dominant public philosophy of our time and finds it flawed. The defect, Sandel maintains, lies in the impoverished vision of citizenship and community shared by Democrats and Republicans alike. American politics has lost its civic voice, leaving both liberals and conservatives unable to inspire the sense of community and civic engagement that self-government requires. In search of a public philosophy adequate to our time, Sandel ranges across the American political experience, recalling the arguments of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and Douglas, Holmes and Brandeis, FDR and Reagan.

He emphasizes the distinctive features of the Nyingma approach but frequently correlates them with their counterparts in the New Translation traditions.

A dedicated exponent of the nonsectarian Rime movement, Khyentse Rinpoche was respected by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism and taught many eminent teachers, including His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

The conflict was infamous for its savage impact on the Biafran people, Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s people, many of whom were starved to death after the Nigerian government blockaded their borders. By then, Chinua Achebe was already a world-renowned novelist, with a young family to protect. He took the Biafran side in the conflict and served his government as a roving cultural ambassador, from which vantage he absorbed the war&#x2019;s full horror. Immediately after, Achebe took refuge in an academic post in the United States, and for more than forty years he has maintained a considered silence on the events of those terrible years, addressing them only obliquely through his poetry. Now, decades in the making, comes a towering reckoning with one of modern Africa&#x2019;s most fateful events, from a writer whose words and courage have left an enduring stamp on world literature. <br><br>Achebe masterfully relates his experience, bothas he lived it and how he has come to understand it. He begins his story with Nigeria&#x2019;s birth pangs and the story of his own upbringing as a man and as a writer so that we might come to understand the country&#x2019;s promise, which turned to horror when the hot winds of hatred began to stir. To read <i>There Was a Country</i> is to be powerfully reminded that artists have a particular obligation, especially during a time of war. All writers, Achebe argues, should be committed writers&#x2014;they should speak for their history, their beliefs, and their people. <br><br>Marrying history and memoir, poetry and prose, <i>There Was a Country </i>is a distillation of vivid firsthand observation and forty years of research and reflection. Wise, humane, and authoritative, it will stand as definitive and reinforce Achebe&#x2019;s place as one of the most vital literary and moral voices of our age.</p><p><b>Chinua Achebe</b> was born in Nigeria in 1930. He has published novels, short stories, essays, and children&#x2019;s books. His volume of poetry <i>Christmas in Biafra</i> was the joint winner of the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize. Of his novels, <i>Arrow of God</i> won the New Statesman-Jock Campbell Award, and <i>Anthills of the Savannah</i> was a finalist for the 1987 Booker Prize. <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, Achebe&#x2019;s masterpiece, has been published in fifty different languages and has sold more than ten million copies internationally since its first publication in 1958. Achebe is the recipient of the Nigerian National Merit Award, Nigeria&#x2019;s highest award for intellectual achievement. In 2007, he won the Man Booker International Prize. He died in March 2013.<p>An Igbo proverb tells us that a man who does not know where the rain began to beat him cannot say where he dried his body.</p><p>The rain that beat Africa began four to five hundred years ago, from the &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; of Africa by Europe, through the transatlantic slave trade to the Berlin Conference of 1885. That controversial gathering of the world&#x2019;s leading European powers precipitated what we now call the Scramble for Africa, which created new boundaries that did violence to Africa&#x2019;s ancient societies and resulted in tension-prone modern states. It took place without African consultation or representation, to say the least.</p><p>Great Britain was handed the area of West Africa that would later become Nigeria, like a piece of chocolate cake at a birthday party. It was one of the most populous regions on the African continent, with over 250 ethnic groups and distinct languages. The northern part of the country was the seat of several ancient kingdoms, such as the Kanem-Bornu&#x2014;which Usman dan Fodio and his jihadists absorbed into the Muslim Fulani Empire. The Middle Belt of Nigeria was the locus of the glorious Nok Kingdom and its world-renowned terra-cotta sculptures. The southern protectorate was home to some of the region&#x2019;s most sophisticated civilizations. In the west, the Oyo and Ife kingdoms once flourished majestically, and in the midwest the incomparable Benin Kingdom elevated artistic distinction to a new level. Across the Niger River in the East, the Calabar and the Nri kingdoms flourished. If the Berlin Conference sealed her fate, then the amalgamation of the southern and northern protectorates inextricably complicated Nigeria&#x2019;s destiny. Animists, Muslims, and Christians alike were held together by a delicate, some say artificial, lattice.</p><p>Britain&#x2019;s indirect rule was a great success in northern and western Nigeria, where affairs of state within this new dispensation continued as had been the case for centuries, with one exception&#x2014;there was a new sovereign, Great Britain, to whom all vassals pledged fealty and into whose coffers all taxes were paid. Indirect rule in Igbo land proved far more challenging to implement. Colonial rule functioned through a newly created and incongruous establishment of &#x201c;warrant chiefs&#x201d;&#x2014;a deeply flawed arrangement that effectively confused and corrupted the Igbo democratic spirit.</p><p>Africa&#x2019;s postcolonial disposition is the result of a people who have lost the habit of ruling themselves. We have also had difficulty running the new systems foisted upon us at the dawn of independence by &#x201c;our colonial masters.&#x201d; Because the West has had a long but uneven engagement with the continent, it is imperative that it understands what happened to Africa. It must also play a part in the solution. A meaningful solution will require the goodwill and concerted efforts on the part of all those who share the weight of Africa&#x2019;s historical burden.</p><p>Most members of my generation, who were born before Nigeria&#x2019;s independence, remember a time when things were very different. Nigeria was once a land of great hope and progress, a nation with immense resources at its disposal&#x2014;natural resources, yes, but even more so, human resources. But the Biafran war changed the course of Nigeria. In my view it was a cataclysmic experience that changed the history of Africa.</p><p>It is for the sake of the future of Nigeria, for our children and grandchildren, that I feel it is important to tell Nigeria&#x2019;s story, Biafra&#x2019;s story, our story, my story.</p></p><h2>The Labyrinth of the World: And the Paradise of the Heart (Classic Reprint)</h2><p>Excerpt from The Labyrinth of the World: And the Paradise of the Heart<br><br>I Feel certain that it is venturesome to attempt to attempt to bring a work of a Bohemian writer before the English-speaking public, now the largest public of readers in the world. Even the name of my country has been known to English readers only in connection with associations that are both incongruous and absurd.<br><br>It seems to me certain that the judgment that Bohemian critics have passed on Komensky's masterpiece, the "Labyrinth of the World," claiming it to be one of the world's great books, is not unfounded or based on patriotic predilections. That the book is so little known must be attributed to various causes. Almost at the time that the "Labyrinth" appeared, Komensky's Church, the "Unity," as it was called, of the Bohemian or "Moravian" brethren, was expelled from Bohemia, and it became impossible for a book, written by so eminent a member of that community, to find readers in those countries where the language in which it was written was almost exclusively known. That language itself declined completely after Bohemian independence had perished in 1620, at the battle of the White Mountain, near Prague.

Examining the fundamental problems of substance, space, and time, Whitehead assesses the impact of Einstein&#39;s theories as well as the then-recent findings of modern physics on the concept of nature. For students and teachers of natural philosophy, this is essential reading. English mathematician and philosopher ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD (1861-1947) contributed significantly to 20th-century logic and metaphysics. With Bertrand Russell he cowrote the landmark Principia Mathematica, and also authored An Inquiry Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, The Function of Reason, and Process and Reality.</p><p>This book is one of Alfred North Whitehead&#39;s most important contributions to natural philosophy. His first concern is with the fundamental problems of substance, space, and time; and the most interesting part of his discussion is, perhaps, his criticism of Einstein&#39;s method of interpreting results, and the alternative development of his own well-known theory of the four-dimensional &#39;Space-Time manifold.&#39;Alfred North Whitehead (1861 1947) was a prominent logician, mathematician and philosopher in the early twentieth century and helped pioneer the &#39;process philosophy&#39; approach to metaphysics.

He then analyzes contemporary nationalisms in historical and comparative perspective, tracing the parallels between the Eastern European nationalisms of today and those of the interwar period.</p><p>This study of nationalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union develops an original account of the interlocking and opposed nationalisms of national minorities, the nationalizing states in which they live, and the external national homelands to which they are linked by external ties."In a series of vigorous and rigorous studies of the shifting triadic relations between 'nationalizing states,' 'national minorities,' and their 'external national homelands' in postimperial Europe and Eurasia, Rogers Brubaker reconfigures and reframes our understanding of the national question - its eclipse, revival, and manifold metamorphoses. Wedding surgical empirical precision with uncanny analytical perspicacity, geographical scope with historical depth, this book is a theoretical breakthrough and clears a new terrain for a reflexive sociology of the ongoing fabrication of everything we subsume under the falsely self-evident name of 'nation.'" Pierre Bourdieu, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociale<br><br>"Brubaker's framing of a `pas de trois' of the nationalizing state, the national minority population, and the national homeland illuminates brilliantly the political dynamics of nationalism. His concepts and descriptions are historically rich and sociologically compelling. It will no longer be possible for me to write about nationalism without reference to this masterful set of essays." David D. Laitin, University of Chicago<br><br>"This book makes it clear that Rogers Brubaker is the most brilliant of the younger generation of scholars of nationalism. If the great theoretical ingenuity is seen in the creation of a conceptual apparatus designed to handle states, what is most impressive is the way in which this leads to high-powered substantive discoveries. Policy makers quite as much as academics can benefit from analyses of Central Europe in the interwar period and after 1989, of differences between Weimar Germany and post-communist Russia, and of differential patterns of the ending of empires. This is a rare achievement, likely to set the terms of debate for many years." John A. Hall<br><br>"Brubaker may be the freshest voice writing on issues of nationalism, ethnicity, and national identity. He brings to the post-Soviet and East European scene not only a deep knowledge of Western Europe but great conceptual imagination."

The Old World and its empires were tearing each other apart, and while most Americans blamed the Germans, pitied the Belgians, and felt kinship with the Allies, they wanted no part in the carnage. Two years into war President Woodrow Wilson won re-election by pledging to keep out of the conflict. Yet by the spring of 1917-by which point millions had been killed for little apparent gain or purpose-the fervor to head "Over There" swept the country. America wanted in.<br><br><em>The Path to War</em> shows us how that happened. Entry into the war resulted from lengthy debate and soul-searching about national identity, as so-called "hyphenated citizens" of Irish and German heritage wrestled with what it meant to be American. Many hoped to keep to the moral high ground, condemning German aggression while withholding from the Allies active support, offering to mediate between the belligerents while keeping clear. Others, including the immensely popular former president Theodore Roosevelt, were convinced that war offered the country the only way to assume its rightful place in world affairs. Neiberg follows American reaction to such events as the sinking of the Lusitania, German terrorism, and the incriminating Zimmermann telegram, shedding light on the dilemmas and crises the country faced as it moved from ambivalence to belligerence. <br><br>As we approach the centenary of the war, the effects of the pivot from peace to war still resonate, as Michael Neiberg's compelling book makes clear. The war transformed the United States into a financial powerhouse and global player, despite the reassertion of isolationism in the years that followed. Examining the social, political, and financial forces at work as well as the role of public opinion and popular culture, <em>The Path to War</em> offers both a compelling narrative and the inescapable conclusion that World War One was no parenthetical exception in the American story but a moment of national self-determination.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael S. Neiberg </strong>is the inaugural Chair of War Studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the United States Army War College. His published work specializes on the First and Second World Wars, notably the American and French experiences. He is the author of many books, including <em>Dance of the Furies: Europe and the Outbreak of World War I </em>and <em>Potsdam: The End of World War II and the Remaking of Europe. </em>He is currently based in Pennsylvania.<br><br>"Considering the importance of America's response to the challenges presented by the First World War, there is-not surprisingly-an extensive body of literature on the American experience in the years leading up to the declaration of war in April 1917. Rarely, if ever, has this story been told as well as in Michael S. Neiberg's <em>The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern America</em> [A] study that is eminently readable, impressively researched, and remarkably thorough in its treatment of the various issues and challenges Americans wrestled with as they found it increasingly difficult, and then finally impossible, to believe the nation's interests would be best served by remaining out of the war."--Ethan S. Rafuse, <em>Army History</em><p></p><br>"Michael Neiberg's <em>The Path to War</em> traces the U.S.'s journey from detached observer to fully-committed participant in the First World War. Neiberg does this with great skill and clarity. The Path to War will become essential reading for those interested in the First World War and how it shaped the USA. It makes an invaluable contribution to a pivotal event in U.S. history."--Glyn Harper, Professor of War Studies, Massey University, New Zealand<p></p><br>"Michael Neiberg has established a deserved reputation as one of the premier US-based historians of World War I, and his latest book does not disappoint. Following on from The Dance of the Furies, his magisterial book on European peoples in 1914, <em>The Path to War</em> gives a challenging and intellectually exciting account of how and why America and its people went to war three years later."--Gary Sheffield PhD, University of Wolverhampton, UK<p></p><br></p><h2>The European Revolutions, 1848 - 1851 (New Approaches to European History)</h2><p>Jonathan Sperber has updated and expanded his study of the European Revolutions between 1848-1851 in this second edition.

Naomi Zack explores how these catastrophes illuminate the existing inequalities in society. By employing the moral systems of utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics to analyze the consequences of recent natural disasters, Zack reveals the special plight of the poor, disabled, and infirm when tragedy strikes. Zack explores the political foundations of social contract theory and dignitarianism and invites readers to rethink the distinction between risk in normal times and risk in disaster. Using both real life and fictional examples, Zack forcefully argues for the preservation of normal moral principles in times of national crisis and emergency, stressing the moral obligation of both individuals and government in preparing for and responding to disaster..</p><p>Naomi Zack is professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon.

Her dedication to the situation of the disadvantaged in disasters and her meticulous analysis of it is admirable. Zack's focus is on disaster preparation, a subject sometimes overlooked in this discussion. The book is very accessible and includes insightful comments on lessons to be learned from literature and popular culture. This is highly commendable in a book whose subject matter will be of interest to many readers outside the academic community. (Per Sandin, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm)<br><br>This book tackles the hard questions about our collective responsibility to plan for and respond to disasters. Zack brings insights from contemporary moral and political philosophy to address the difficult question of who counts when disaster strikes.

This book should be required reading for anyone concerned with ethical and human dimensions of disaster planning and response. (Bill E. Lawson, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, University of Memphis)<br><br>This welcome work significantly fills a vacuum in disaster studies and emergency management literature. Taking a no-nonsense approach using real-life and fictional examples, Zack highlights the moral and ethical obligations that citizens and governments have in preparing for and responding to the results and aftermath of disasters. . . . This very thought-provoking book may serve as a template to those charged with the responsibility of planning for, responding to, and minimizing the deleterious effect of disasters. It should be required reading for anyone concerned with the ethical and human aspects of disaster planning and emergency management. Scholars, practitioners, and the general public will greatly benefit from reading it. Highly recommended. (<i>CHOICE, December 2009</i>)<br><br>This is a remarkable book. . . .

Reeves is at Wisconsin Policy Research Institute.From the author of The Empty Church (1996) comes another ideology-saturated piece of propaganda masquerading as history. Twentieth-Century America claims to be a college textbook, but it is really a lament about the crumbling of traditional values. In a chapter called The Best Years, Reeves declares that to a great many Americans who lived through them, the years 1953 to 1963 were an especially pleasant time in this countrys history. Before we can suggest that Betty Friedan (not to mention Rosa Parks) might take issue with his description of life under Eisenhower, Reeves quotes a 1995 journalists assertion that elderly women who were young mothers in the suburbs during the `50s would tell you those were the best years they can remember. His portrait of the centurys close is revealing: He crows about the collapse of welfare as we know it, and wonders where have all the morals gone. Reeves relies entirely on the work of William Raspberry and Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom when discussing African-Americans in the `90s, and he is more concerned with black participation in the sports stadium than in the voting booth (the large photograph of Michael Jordan will tell you youre on the right page). The erosion of Christendom is a favorite theme, and in the final chapter Reeves proclaims that the courts, in the name of the separation of church and state, were a major force in restricting the impact of the Christian faith. Among other things, they outlawed prayer in the public schools and drove Christian symbols out of public places. The highly influential New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, applauded these rulings. Somehow, Reeves neglects to mention that the NYTs and the ACLUs applause was part of an international Jewish plot. If you want to learn about contemporary cultural conservatism, start here; if youre interested in the nations past, skip Twentieth-Century America.

In this new book, the authors outline the philosophy behind Learning Stories and call on the latest findings from the research projects they have led with teachers on learning dispositions and learning power to argue that Learning Stories can construct learner identities in early childhood settings and schools. By making the connection between sociocultural approaches to pedagogy and assessment and narrative inquiry, this book contextualizes learning stories as a philosophical approach to education, learning and pedagogy. <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapters explore how Learning Stories:</p> <p>" help make connections with families;</p> <p>" support the inclusion of children and family voices;</p> <p>" tell us stories about babies;</p> <p>" allow children to dictate their own stories;</p> <p>" can be used to revisit children&#x2032;s learning journeys;</p> <p>" can contribute to teaching and learning wisdom.</p> <p></p> <p>This ground-breaking book expands on the concept of Learning Stories, and includes examples from practice in both New Zealand and the UK.

It decisively ended the threat of a Persian conquest of Greece. It involved tens of thousands of combatants, including the largest number of Greeks ever brought together in a common cause. For the Spartans, the driving force behind the Greek victory, the battle was sweet vengeance for their defeat at Thermopylae the year before. Why has this pivotal battle been so overlooked?<br><br>In <em>After Thermopylae,</em> Paul Cartledge masterfully reopens one of the great puzzles of ancient Greece to discover, as much as possible, what happened on the field of battle and, just as important, what happened to its memory. Part of the answer to these questions, Cartledge argues, can be found in a little-known oath reputedly sworn by the leaders of Athens, Sparta, and several other Greek city-states prior to the battle-the Oath of Plataea. Through an analysis of this oath, Cartledge provides a wealth of insight into ancient Greek culture. He shows, for example, that when the Athenians and Spartans were not fighting the Persians they were fighting themselves, including a propaganda war for control of the memory of Greece's defeat of the Persians. This helps explain why today we readily remember the Athenian-led victories at Marathon and Salamis but not Sparta's victory at Plataea. Indeed, the Oath illuminates Greek anxieties over historical memory and over the Athens-Sparta rivalry, which would erupt fifty years after Plataea in the Peloponnesian War. In addition, because the Oath was ultimately a religious document, Cartledge also uses it to highlight the profound role of religion and myth in ancient Greek life. With compelling and eye-opening detective work, <em>After Thermopylae</em> provides a long-overdue history of the Battle of Plataea and a rich portrait of the Greek ethos during one of the most critical periods in ancient history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Cartledge</strong> is the inaugural A.G.

His endeavour has produced a carefully and well-researched book, which stands as an important contribution not only to ancient Greek warfare but also to the larger issues of reception and cultural memory." --<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"Filled with rich detail, interesting etymologies, and wonderful contrasts, this work is a reminder that history (as readers are reminded, a term initiated by Herodotus, meaning 'enquiry') is subject to interpretation, manipulation, and exploitation. ...

For those interested in the Graeco-Persian Wars and how the Greeks came to understand their own history, it is a book well worth the read." --Nikolaus Overtoom, <em>H-War</em><p></p><br>"Cartledge, in his latest work, has extricated the battle from where it has languished as 'unheralded,' and elevated it to a position in which it is firmly entrenched in the pantheon of the other celebrated Greek battles... This is an excellent work for anyone interested in the history of the Greeks or in historical memory." --<em>Strategy Page</em><p></p><br>"<em>After Thermopylae</em> is a historical detective story, unraveling the mysteries of the Oath of Plataea, one of the most famous but least understood documents in Greek history. Paul Cartledge tears away the veil of myths that the Greeks wove around their great victory over the Persians at Plataea to expose a fascinating, unsuspected story of ancient culture wars. Essential reading for anyone interested in the politics of the past." --Ian Morris, author of <em>Why the West Rules--For Now</em><p></p><br>"As a student of the Battle of Salamis, I was fascinated by this account, by a distinguished historian, of the Battle of Plataea and its afterlife.

"IAfter Thermopylae vividly explores the remarkable story of the battle -- a more significant turning point in history than the famous clashes that preceded it -- and its afterlife. This fascinating material deserves to be much better known, and no one is better than Paul Cartledge at making ancient history accessible to a wide audience." --Hans van Wees, author of <em>Greek Warfare: Myths and</em> <em>Realities</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Handbook of Technical Writing</h2><p>From abstracts to online professional profiles, from blogs and forums to formal reports and manuals, the Handbook of Technical Writing uses smart, accessible language to spotlight and clarify technical writing today.

The Marshall Plan comes to mind, as does the Civil Rights Act. But perhaps none resonates in the American imagination like the G.I. Bill.<br><br>In a brilliant addition to Oxford's acclaimed Pivotal Moments in American History series, historians Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin offer a compelling and often surprising account of the G.I. Bill and its sweeping and decisive impact on American life. Formally known as the Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944, it was far from an obvious, straightforward piece of legislation, but resulted from tense political maneuvering and complex negotiations. As Altschuler and Blumin show, an unlikely coalition emerged to shape and pass the bill, bringing together both New Deal Democrats and conservatives who had vehemently opposed Roosevelt's social-welfare agenda. For the first time in American history returning soldiers were not only supported, but enabled to pursue success--a revolution in America's policy towards its veterans. <br><br>Once enacted, the G.I. Bill had far-reaching consequences. By providing job training, unemployment compensation, housing loans, and tuition assistance, it allowed millions of Americans to fulfill long-held dreams of social mobility, reshaping the national landscape. The huge influx of veterans and federal money transformed the modern university and the surge in single home ownership vastly expanded America's suburbs. Perhaps most important, as Peter Drucker noted, the G.I. Bill "signaled the shift to the knowledge society." The authors highlight unusual or unexpected features of the law--its color blindness, the frankly sexist thinking behind it, and its consequent influence on race and gender relations. Not least important, Altschuler and Blumin illuminate its role in individual lives whose stories they weave into this thoughtful account.<br><br>Written with insight and narrative verve by two leading historians, <em>The G.I. Bill</em> makes a major contribution to the scholarship of postwar America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Glenn C.

This volume highlights both the accomplishments of the ancient societies and the remaining research problems, and stimulates further progress in the history of ancient technology. The subject matter of the book is the technological framework of the Greek and Roman cultures from ca. 800 B.C. through ca. A.D. 500 in the circum-Mediterranean world and Northern Europe. Each chapter discusses a technology or family of technologies from an analytical rather than descriptive point of view, providing a critical summation of our present knowledge of the Greek and Roman accomplishments in the technology concerned and the evolution of their technical capabilities over the chronological period. Each presentation reviews the issues and recent contributions, and defines the capacities and accomplishments of the technology in the context of the society that used it, the available "technological shelf," and the resources consumed. These studies introduce and synthesize the results of excavation or specialized studies. The chapters are organized in sections progressing from sources (written and representational) to primary (e.g., mining, metallurgy, agriculture) and secondary (e.g., woodworking, glass production, food preparation, textile production and leather-working) production, to technologies of social organization and interaction (e.g., roads, bridges, ships, harbors, warfare and fortification), and finally to studies of general social issues (e.g., writing, timekeeping, measurement, scientific instruments, attitudes toward technology and innovation) and the relevance of ethnographic methods to the study of classical technology.

Preserving cultural landscapes-the combined fabric of the natural and man-made environments-is a relatively new and often misunderstood idea among preservationists, but it is of increasing importance. The essays collected in this volume-case studies that include the Little Tokyo neighborhood in Los Angeles, the Cross Bronx Expressway, and a rural island in Puget Sound-underscore how this approach can be fruitfully applied. Together, they make clear that a cultural landscape perspective can be an essential underpinning for all historic preservation projects. </p><p>Contributors: Susan Calafate Boyle, National Park Service; Susan Buggey, U of Montreal; Michael Caratzas, Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYC); Courtney P.

Several months earlier, in Lexington, Kentucky, another black man was denied the right to vote for simply failing to pay a poll tax. Both events typified the intense opposition to the federal guarantee of black voting rights. Both events led to landmark Supreme Court decisions. And, as Robert Goldman shows, both events have much to tell us about an America that was still deeply divided over the status of blacks during the Reconstruction era.<br><br>Goldman deftly highlights the cases of United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank within the context of an ongoing power struggle between state and federal authorities and the realities of being black in postwar America. Focusing especially on the so-called Reconstruction Amendments and Enforcement Acts, he argues that the decisions in <i>Reese</i> and <i>Cruikshank</i> signaled an enormous gap between guaranteed and enforced rights. The Court's decisions denied the very existence of any such guarantee and, further, conferred upon the states the right to determine who may vote and under what circumstances.<br><br>In both decisions, lower court convictions were overturned through suprisingly narrrow rulings, despite the larger constitutional issues involved. In Reese the Court justified its decision by voicing only two sections of the Enforcement Acts, while in Cruikshank it merely voided the original indictments as being "insufficient in law" by failing to allege that the Grant Parish murders had been explicitly motivated by racial concerns.<br><br>Such legalistic reasoning marked the grim beginning of a nearly century-long struggle to reclaim what the Fifteenth Amendment had supposedly guaranteed. As Goldman shows, the Court's decisions undermined the fledgling efforts of the newly formed justice department and made it increasingly difficult to control the racial violence, intimidation, poll taxes, and other less visible means used by white southern Democrats to "redeem" their political power. The result was a disenfranchised black society in a hostile and still segregated South. Only with the emergence of a nationwide civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did things begin to change.<br><br>Readable and insightful, Goldman's study offers students, scholars, and concerned citizens a strong reminder of what happens when courts refuse to enforce constitutional and legislated law&#x2014;and what might happen again if we aren't vigilant in protecting the rights of all Americans.</p><p>"An exemplary constitutional-legal history that illuminates how Reconstruction's ground became so dark and bloody."--Harold M.

Who produced the first stage adaptation of "The Wizard of Oz" in 1902-nearly forty years before the movie classic? What entertainment juggernaut began in a converted Chinese laundry on Wells Street in 1959? Where did Louis (Studs) Terkel make his stage debut? When did the original production of "Grease" open at Kingston Mines Theater? Richard Christiansen, former chief critic for the Chicago Tribune, answers these and many more questions about the rich role of the theater in Chicago, from its earliest days in 1837 to its present state as a diverse community of artists with international stature.<br><br> In <i>A Theater of Our Own</i>, he draws upon his exclusive interviews, insights, and memories gathered over a period of more than forty years of reviewing the arts. This history and memoir traces the evolution of the Chicago theater scene from small theaters to major institutions such as the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, the Goodman Theater, and The Second City. Along the way, Richard Christiansen relates his behind-the-scenes conversations with some of Chicago's most acclaimed writers, directors, and actors--David Mamet, Frank Galati, Mary Zimmerman, John Malkovich, Laurie Metcalf, Harold Ramis, Gary Sinise, and Joe Mantegna--all a part of Chicago's theater renaissance from the 1970s onward. To this day, Chicago remains a city known for its imaginative, innovative, and influential theaters and artists. <i>A Theater of Our Own</i>, a valuable contribution to the history of theater, is a book written for anyone who enjoys the theater and its people as well as the story of Chicago.</p><p>Richard Christiansen has been an arts journalist for more than forty years, covering theater, dance, film, the visual arts, and a variety of arts and entertainment subjects in Chicago, the nation, and abroad. He began his career in 1956 as a reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago and moved to the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> a year later. In 1978, he joined the <i>Chicago Tribune </i>as its critic-at-large, arts and entertainment editor, and, finally, chief critic and senior writer, a post he held until his retirement in 2002.<br>*Starred Review* In the past 40 years, Chicago has grown from a place ragtag touring companies passed through on their way to downstate Illinois into what British critic Michael Billington calls one of the most important theater towns in North America. Many of the top actors and directors working today, including talents as diverse as John Malkovich, Bill Murray, and Tina Fey, cut their teeth there. Chicago-based arts journalist Christiansen watched it all happen, as a reporter for first the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> and then the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. Now retired, he is ideally suited to chronicle the Chicago theater movement. Written in the sometimes dry but fact-packed style of well-edited Sunday features, his book begins with the earliest theatrical enterprises in pre-fire Chicago and touches every major theater event, including the Iroquois Theatre fire and the Depression-era WPA, that preceded the great flowering of theaters in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a blooming that, as Christiansen notes, continues to this day. Christiansen's effort will be an invaluable resource for anyone wanting to find out about the theaters and the companies that put Chicago on the theatrical map and keep it there. <i>Jack Helbig</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This book chronicles her developing poetic sensibility, emergent Buddhist practice, and what it meant to be a woman trying to write in pre-feminist Beat days. Attentive, witty, and always entertaining, this is poet&#x2019;s prose at its best.</p><p>One of the major poets of the Beat Generation,&nbsp;JOANNE KYGER&nbsp;was born in 1934. In 1960, she traveled to Japan to be with her then-husband Gary Snyder. In 1962 they traveled to India, where, along with Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, they met the Dalai Lama. She returned to California in 1964 and settled in Bolinas in 1969, where she resides today. She has published over 30 books of poetry and prose, including On Time and As Ever: Selected Poems.&#x201c;Here is a classic of zig-zag Zen. It conjures an era when certain Americans, seeing the pointlessness of USA consumerism, went overseas. They were willing to live cheap, immerse themselves in Zen and yoga, and learn Asian life-ways. You watch Joanne Kyger become a poet in these pages&#x2015;writing daily, schooling herself in travel, friendship, marriage (unexpected), and the customs of post-War Japan. Four months in India with Snyder and Ginsberg recall a time when the adventuresome could walk in and talk to the Dalai Lama, stay at the Aurobindo Ashram, or match wits with sadhus, yogis, and philosophers.

And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

In their role as &#x201c;escorts&#x201d; to Flying Fortresses and Liberators, the fighter squadrons&#x2019; ability to blast enemy aircraft from the sky was key to the success of pinpoint bombing raids on German oil refineries, communication and supply lines, and other crucial targets. <br><br>Flying in formation with the bomber stream, Fortier and the rest of his squadron helped develop dive-bombing and strafing tactics for the Thunderbolts and Mustangs. As the war progressed, fighter squadrons began to carry out their own bombing missions. From blasting V-1 missile sites along France&#x2019;s &#x201c;rocket coast&#x201d; and the hell-torn action of D day to the critical attacks on the Ruhr Valley and massive daylight raids on German industrial targets, Fortier was part of the Allies&#x2019; bitter struggle to bring the Nazi war machine to a halt. In describing his own hundred-plus missions and by including the accounts of fellow fighter pilots, Fortier recaptures the excitement and fiery terror of the world&#x2019;s most dangerous cat-and-mouse game.</p><p><b>Norman &#x201c;Bud&#x201d; Fortier</b> was born in New Hampshire in 1922. In January 1942 he joined the Army Air Corps and became a fighter pilot assigned to the Eighth Air Force&#x2019;s famed 355th Fighter Group. He flew 113 missions and rose to squadron command. He is officially credited with 5.8 aerial combat victories during the war.<br><br>After the war Fortier graduated from the University of New Hampshire and went on to fly for Northwest Orient Airlines. Recalled to active duty in 1947 for the Berlin Airlift, he remained in the air force. After retiring from the air force in 1964 as a lieutenant colonel, he became an elementary school teacher and principal.Flight Training<br><br>On January 21, 1942, I raised my right hand at the army recruiting center in Manchester, New Hampshire, and was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Corps as a flying cadet. I didn't look closely at the "Agreement to Serve" I signed. I agreed to serve for "the duration of the war plus six months," but I also agreed that I would not marry while still a cadet. According to my pre-induction physical, I was 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighed 135 pounds.<br><br>The finality of what I had done was beginning to sink in. I was alone, and for the first time in my life, cut off from the security of home and family-and I was scared.<br><br>Within two hours, I was on my way to Maxwell Field in Montgomery, Alabama, along with Clarence (Bo) Beauregard from Marlborough, New Hampshire; Maurice (Moe) Cashman from Franklin, New Hampshire; Jim Owens from Haverhill, Massachusetts; and Henry J. (Hank) Pascho from Somerville, Massachusetts. At twenty-six, Bo was the oldest of the group; at nineteen, I was the youngest.<br><br>We didn't get to know each other until after we changed trains in Washington, D.C., and found ourselves in adjoining berths on the Seaboard Atlantic Railroad headed south. We had two small compartments, each with pull-down bunks and enough room to sit around and socialize before bedtime.<br><br>We were playing cards early that evening in one of the compartments when someone suggested that we might be able to get a bottle of whiskey from the porter. "I'll see what I can do at the next station," he promised. After the next stop, we had a rather expensive bottle of rotgut whiskey and a bottle of ginger ale to help chase it down.<br><br>I was out of my element. I was not a drinker. I hadn't had anything stronger than a glass of wine in my life. But I was now in the army. And army people drank liquor. So I had a few whiskeys and ginger ale, and soon the small compartment became a more pleasant place. I was no longer with strangers, no longer scared; I was among friends!<br><br>We played poker, for small stakes because none of us had much money, but we were in the army now, and our perception was that army people drank whiskey and played poker. I did not win any money that night, but I did learn three valuable lessons: Never drink whiskey when you play poker, never play poker with people who really know how to play the game, and there's no such thing as "a friendly little game of poker."<br><br>About noon on January 23, the porter came through the cars announcing that we were approaching Montgomery, Alabama. We gathered our luggage and stood by the exit as the train lurched to a stop. As we stepped down, a tall, rugged-looking sergeant directed us to a waiting army bus. We were surprised that about thirty other cadets were on the same train. With more than thirty cadets and their luggage, the bus to Maxwell Field was full.<br><br>We didn't quite get to Maxwell Field. The bus stopped in front of an old, shabby-looking two-story building. "This is where you get off," said the sergeant. "Welcome to the Old Mill."<br><br>The Old Mill was an old textile mill, condemned as unsafe and closed-until the crunch of hundreds of cadets exceeded the capacity of Maxwell Field to absorb them. This was a "temporary" facility: two floors with roughly fifty cadets on each floor, in two-tiered bunks. We were issued sheets and blankets, and a bunk number: A was bottom bunk, B was top. Bo and I shared the same bunk number; he chose top.<br><br>In the next few days, we were subjected to a number of indignities: extra-short haircuts; clothing that didn't fit and had to be reissued; immunization shots to prevent smallpox, tetanus, typhoid, and yellow fever; and the ever-present drill sergeants who marched us to and from the mess hall at Maxwell Field three times a day. "Why can't you civilians understand what a column is? Don't you know how to stay in ranks? Do you really expect to be cadets?"<br><br>We learned. In a few weeks, we could march to and from the mess hall at Maxwell Field, about a quarter of a mile away, in some semblance of order but never to the satisfaction of the drill sergeant. We sent our civilian clothes back home: "You won't be needing those for a while," the sergeant told us.<br><br>Then came the lectures: military customs and laws, navigation, meteorology, aircraft recognition, and the like. What I remember most was the physical fitness routine. Every day, we had calisthenics: hop-straddle exercises and push-ups and all kinds of traditional drills designed to drain energy from young studs to make them more amenable to discipline. The ultimate routine was what we called the Burma Road, a tortuous two-mile run through the woods and swamps surrounding Maxwell Field, led by a physical fitness nut who set the pace while another brought up the rear to discourage stragglers. There were streams to jump over and hills to climb, but the worst part was the stretch along the edge of the golf course where we could see women playing golf in the distance. They looked young and attractive from our vantage point, but it may have been a blessing that we never saw them up close. We could dream.<br><br>At the end of the third week, we were given "open post" (permission to leave the base) while at the Old Mill. We went into town and I drank two "Zombies," strong rum drinks popular at the time. I have no recollection of getting back to the Old Mill that night; Bo guided me to my bunk. I do recall that the old building rocked and swayed and even did a few aerobatic routines that buildings are not designed to do, and I was sicker than I had ever been before. The next morning's calisthenics were brutal.<br><br>In late February we were assigned to Craig Field in Selma, Alabama. Finally, we thought, we were being assigned to primary flying school. We were wrong. At Craig Field, we were, as we called it, in "cold storage" until openings for primary flight training became available. There was no Old Mill at Craig Field. We were in cadet barracks, four to a room with adjoining bathroom facilities shared with the four cadets next door.<br><br>The routine was the same: Morse code, aircraft recognition, calisthenics, close-order drill, obstacle course, the "Burma Road" torture trail, and all the classroom lectures we had almost memorized by then.<br><br>On our second weekend, we were given open post and ordered to return by midnight. Bo and I found a small dingy bar in Selma. He ordered a rye and ginger. Still a neophyte at the drinking game, I ordered the same. I was three months shy of my twentieth birthday, but that didn't bother the bartender. I suppose he figured that anyone in uniform was old enough to drink. We had a few more. Bo had to help me home again.<br><br>The weeks dragged by. Craig Field was an advanced flying school, so we saw AT-6 advanced trainers taking off and landing, but we never got near the flight line. It was a frustrating and monotonous time.<br><br>We were in Class 42-K, scheduled to graduate in December 1942. When May rolled around, we figured that Class 42-K would be leaving for primary flight school soon. We were right. There was a problem, however. There were too many cadets in cold storage and not enough slots in primary flying schools. So half of the cadet corps went on to primary flight schools in the Southeast Training Command; the rest-including me-were reassigned to class 43-A and given a thirty-day furlough, whether we wanted one or not.<br><br>So four months after becoming a "flying" cadet, I was back home, without once having left the ground, except in the hop-straddle exercises of daily calisthenics. It was nice being home, of course, and I was treated like a hero even though I had done nothing approaching heroic.<br><br>The thirty days passed at a snail's pace, and finally I headed back to Maxwell Field for assignment to my first flying school.<br><br>Primary<br><br>Special Order 48 read, "The following named aviation cadets are transferred to AAFTD Embry-Riddle Company, Dorr Field, Arcadia, Florida," followed by the names of 240 cadets. We left Montgomery via troop train on July 5 and arrived at Arcadia at 10:00 a.m the next day. This was not an express train. We were tired and hot by the time we were loaded onto the army trucks for the trip to Dorr Field, about five miles east of Arcadia. This was cattle country; there was not a hill to be seen on any horizon.<br><br>Though technically an Army Air Forces Training Detachment, Dorr Field was an Embry-Riddle civilian flight school supervised by the Army Air Forces. All the flight instructors were civilians, but USAAF lieutenants were stationed there for the express purpose of weeding out the unfit. We called them the washboard; they gave the flight checks at the end of each training phase. If you had trouble on your first flight check, you were given one more, by a different lieutenant. If he didn't like the way you flew either, you washed out. Most of the cadets who washed out were reassigned to navigator or bombardier training.<br><br>Cadet quarters were in rectangles, four quarters to a side. Each quarter had eight cadets, four in each room connected by one bathroom to the next room. There were thirty-two cadets on each side of the rectangle.<br><br>As usual, quarters were assigned alphabetically, so I was in a room with Bob Damico, Vic DeSoto, and Carmen Felice. Carmen was one of those people who look like they need a shave one hour after they've shaved. He was also one of those cadets who seemed to be marching out of step even when they weren't. For some reason, when his feet were in step, his head wasn't, so his head was always bobbing up when the rest of the heads were bobbing down. "Keep in step, Felice!" the drill instructors yelled.<br><br>"Yes, sir!" he would respond, though he was convinced that he was in step.<br><br>Vic DeSoto was from Tarrytown, New York, and his accent sounded typical Brooklyn to the rest of us. He was short, probably close to the lower limit for acceptance in the Cadet Corps, and stocky. He was a worrier. He didn't have much confidence that he could get past primary flight school. He was well liked, and when his own worst scenario came true and he washed out, we were all sorry to see him leave.<br><br>Bob Damico was the quintessential character. Always good-natured and upbeat, he was the constant provider of funny stories, pranks, and good cheer. It didn't take long for his reputation to reach the upperclassmen, and he soon became one of their favorite targets.<br><br>Hazing of incoming cadets by upperclassmen was a tradition in the prewar flying cadet program. It consisted entirely of drill-instructor-style, in-your-face shouted commands and comments designed to humiliate and demean the lowly incoming cadets. Physical abuse was never permitted-upperclassmen were even required to ask permission to touch another cadet-but underclassmen were expected to obey all reasonable commands of their tormentors. The favorite expression was "Hit a brace, Mister!" A brace was an exaggerated position of attention. The victim was then subjected to verbal abuse and commands such as "Suck that gut in, Mister!" and "Get those shoulders back! Keep your head up, Mister!" and "Don't look at me, Mister! Eyes straight ahead!" An underclassman had to hold that position until he appeared to be on the verge of fainting, at which time the upperclassman barked, "At ease, Mister!"<br><br>In primary flight school, hazing by upperclassmen was not officially permitted, but was not discouraged either. After the evening meal, they were allowed to roam the quarters of newly assigned cadets, making life miserable with their overbearing orders and comments. Hazing time was limited to one hour, however, because everyone needed time to study or just relax.<br><br>Bob Damico was a favorite target, which was not good for the rest of us, because he always came up with a funny remark that started us giggling, and that brought down the feigned wrath of the upperclassmen, who also had great difficulty in trying to keep from laughing. One evening when he heard upperclassmen coming, Bob squeezed into one of the clothes lockers. He was in his underwear, but it was still a tight fit. "Close the door," he told us, "and tell them I'm not here." As expected, three upperclassmen came into the room, looking for Damico. After putting the rest of us in a brace, they demanded to know where he was. We maintained a stony silence.<br><br>After about five minutes of badgering, we still hadn't given him away, but he was quite uncomfortable in the locker and started squirming to ease the strain. They heard him. One of them walked to the locker and yelled, "Are you in there, Damico?"<br><br>In a high falsetto, Bob replied, "Ain't nobody in here but us clothes."<br><br>That broke us all up, even the upperclassmen, who quickly recovered their composure and laced into us with renewed vigor. It was mid-July and hot. They left him in that locker for about ten more minutes. When he finally was released, he could hardly stand at attention, much less in a brace. The upperclassmen roasted him a bit, then departed. After all, they enjoyed him too much to make him really angry.<br><br>The hazing rankled, especially in view of the fact that the upperclassmen were only about one month ahead of us in the training schedule. Some of them were washing out of the cadet program at the time they gave us grief. We put up with it, believing we had no other choice. A month later, when we were upperclassmen, a few of our classmates took up the practice, but most of us felt it was silly and we left the new cadets alone. Hazing was officially prohibited shortly thereafter.<br><br>Bob and I became close friends. Felice washed out soon after DeSoto did, so Bob and I had the room to ourselves. We spent our off-post time together, but there was little to do in Arcadia on weekends.<br><br>Neither of us had any difficulty with the flying program. The primary trainer was the Stearman PT-17, exactly the same as the PT-13 except that the PT-17 had a Continental engine rather than the Lycoming engine in the PT-13. It was also nearly identical in appearance and performance to the Waco UPF-7 that I had flown during secondary CPTP back in New Hampshire. I had more than forty hours in the UPF-7, and there were no maneuvers in primary that I hadn't done before, so I had no difficulty completing the flying phase in the PT-17. The washout rate was nearly 50 percent, most of them in Phase One, during which the student was expected to solo.<br><br>-- PrePress Department Westchester Book 7 Finance Drive Danbury CT 06810 Voice: 1-203-791-0080 Fax: 1-203-791-9286 e-mail: prepress@wbrt.com</p><h2>The Times Were a Changin&#39;: The Sixties Reader</h2><p>This is a must-have anthology of the milestone speeches, manifestos, court decisions, and groundbreaking journalism of the Sixties.

Dewey&#x2019;s insights into the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to science are as fresh today as when they were first published. His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing relevance at the turn of the 21st century.</p><p>Based on the award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey&#x2019;s work, The Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of Dewey&#x2019;s writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey&#x2019;s intellectual development over time; the selection represents his mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context; Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and Inquiry; Valuation and Ethics; The Aims of Education; The Individual, the Community, and Democracy; Pragmatism and Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and Interpretations and Critiques.

It&#39;s not just another self-help remedy, therapy, or technique. It&#39;s taking responsibility for one&#39;s health and life in a completely new, holistic way. It requires a dynamic, intentional transformation of mind and heart that leads to a profound shift in health and healing. Integral health is the next evolutionary step in human development. Too good to be true? Not so, says Elliott S. Dacher, M.D., who practiced internal medicine for more than twenty years. Frustrated when he could not treat his patients&#39; underlying suffering, Dacher searched for a deeper source of healing, finding inspiration in Eastern philosophies that stressed the connection between mind and body. That prompted him to create this comprehensive program of integral health, based on author Ken Wilber&#39;s integral theory of consciousness. Dacher&#39;s program centers on four aspects of human existence--the inner aspects of the psychospiritual and the interpersonal and the outer aspects of the biological and the interpersonal. The reader learns how to deal with and make transformative shifts through each of the aspects using various contemplative practices that increase mind/body awareness and connection. In addition, the reader learns how to do an integral assessment involving all four aspects, design a personalized program of integral practice, and progress toward integral health. Not for someone seeking a quick fix, integral health demands a commitment to seeking the highest level of authentic health, happiness, and wholeness. For anyone who is seeking more and wishes to make the effort, Dacher shows the way to fulfill one&#39;s highest potential and lea a healthy life.</p><p>Author of Whole Healing, and Intentional Healing.

Using his own considerable storytelling powers, Lucado relates the biblical principles found in Romans to the stories of ordinary people like his father to fashion inspirational interpretations of the book of Romans for everyday life. Admitting that Romans is often difficult for Christians to read because of its focus on God's wrath and God's punishment of human sinfulness, Lucado translates and interprets the biblical texts to demonstrate that God's righteousness and justice are merely indicators of the mercy and lovingkindness inherent in God's grace. Through these readings, Lucado reminds readers of the eternal quality of God's mercy and the gentleness of his love. While Lucado's book is not a compendium of deep theological insights, his graceful style and his thorough exposition of biblical texts will grant rewards to interested readers. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Craft of Interviewing</h2><p>John Brady, editor of Writer&#39;s Digest and himself an accomplished interviewer, has put together an indispensable guide to the art of questioning. In a lively, down-to-earth manner, &#34;The Craft of Interviewing&#34; covers all aspects of the interview process -- getting the interview, doing research, handling the subject face-to-face, hurdling hazards, getting tough, taking notes (on the sly, if need be), taping, dealing with off-the-record types, concluding the interview, verifying it, and writing it up. Brady has also filled the book with a myriad of anecdotes revealing the experiences of some of the best known interviewers of our times.

Indeed, one can't help but cringe as the veteran journalist records the alarming post-Cold War floundering of the C.I.A., N.S.A., Defense Department, and succeeding administrations in the face of burgeoning terrorist threats that culminate with the attack on 9-11. Seemingly caught flatfooted by the demise of the Soviet Union, the U.S. intelligence community stumbles through the 1990s as it becomes institutionally hidebound and sluggish. During relatively peaceful times, its shortcomings, while not unnoticed, remain largely unaddressed. As Bamford sees it, with the arrival of George W. Bush, the situation goes from bad to worse. With the neocons in power, intelligence gathering is corrupted and politicized to create the grounds for going to war with Iraq. While much of what appears here has appeared earlier in works by Joseph Wilson, Richard Clarke, and others, Bamford pulls the loose ends together and adds new reporting to create a wide-ranging yet taut and absorbing expose of an American security apparatus that combines vast power with stunning ineptitude. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>In A Pretext for War, acclaimed author James Bamford-whose classic book The Puzzle Palace first revealed the existence of the National Security Agency-draws on his unparalleled access to top intelligence sources to produce a devastating expos? of the intelligence community and the Bush administration. <br>A Pretext for War" reveals the systematic weaknesses behind the failure to detect or prevent the 9/11 attacks, and details the Bush administration's subsequent misuse of intelligence to sell preemptive war to the American people.

The largest group of Johnstones are to be found near the English border in Dumfriesshire, in the southwest, but they are also to be found in significant numbers much further northeast, in Aberdeenshire - but no matter where they hail from, Johnstones are considered to be members of the same clan. But it is with the Borders that they are particularly associated and where, along with other clans and families such as the Maxwells, they led dangerous lives as reivers, or raiders, feuding with their neighbours. Despite their lawless ways, however, they later gained high honours and distinction, with James Johnstone, son of Sir James Johnstone of Dunskellie, being created Lord Johnstone of Lochwood in 1633. Presented here are the stirring and colourful lives and times of the Johnstones. This little book contains, where available, the clan motto, crest and tartan, in addition to the history of the name.</p><p></p><h2>A Terrible Beauty : The People and Ideas That Shaped the Modern Mind - A History</h2><p>Terrible Beauty presents a unique narrative of the twentieth century. Unlike more conventional histories, where the focus is on political events and personalities, on wars, treaties and elections, this book concentrates on the ideas that made the century so rich, rewarding and provocative. Beginning with four seminal ideas which were introduced in 1900 - the unconscious, the gene, the quantum and Picasso&#39;s first paintings in Paris - the book brings together the main areas of thought and juxtaposes the most original and influential ideas of our time in an immensely readable narrative. From the creation of plastic to Norman Mailer, from the discovery of the &#39;Big Bang&#39; to the Counterculture, from Relativity to Susan Sontag, from Proust to Salman Rushdie, and Henri Bergson to Saul Bellow, the book&#39;s range is encyclopedic. We meet in these pages the other twentieth century, the writers, the artists, the scientists and philosophers who were not cowed by the political and military disasters raging around them, and produced some of the most amazing and rewarding ideas by which we live. Terrible Beauty, endlessly stimulating and provocative, affirms that there was much more to the twentieth century than war and genocide.</p><p>Peter Watson was born in 1943 and educated at the universities of Durham, London and Rome.

In order to demonstrate how medical research has influenced Western cultural perspectives, the editors have collected original works from 61 different authors around nine major themes (among them &#34;Anatomy and Destiny,&#34; &#34;Psyche and Soma,&#34; and &#34;The Construction of Pain, Suffering, and Death&#34;). The authors range from Aristotle, the Bible, and Louis Pasteur, to Masters and Johnson, Ernest Hemingway, and Simone de Beauvoir. The primary sources selected to illustrate the themes are well chosen and contrast with each other nicely. However, the brief background material for the selections center around the authors and offer little or no discussion about the selections&#39; relevance to the topics at hand. This book would be best read in a class or group where the texts&#39; meaning in relation to each other can be discussed, but the book can stand alone if the reader is prepared to do some critical thinking.</p><p></p><h2>Dust: A Novel (Jacob&#39;s Ladder)</h2><p>On a broken ship orbiting a doomed sun, dwellers have grown complacent with their aging metal world. But when a serving girl frees a captive noblewoman, the old order is about to change....<b><br><br></b>Ariane, Princess of the House of Rule, was known to be fiercely cold-blooded. But severing an angel&#x2019;s wings on the battlefield&#x2014;even after she had surrendered&#x2014;proved her completely without honor. Captive, the angel Perceval waits for Ariane not only to finish her off&#x2014;but to devour her very memories and mind. Surely her gruesome death will cause war between the houses&#x2014;exactly as Ariane desires. But Ariane&#x2019;s plan may yet be opposed, for Perceval at once recognizes the young servant charged with her care. <br><br>Rien is the lost child: her sister. Soon they will escape, hoping to stop the impending war and save both their houses. But it is a perilous journey through the crumbling hulk of a dying ship, and they do not pass unnoticed. Because at the hub of their turning world waits Jacob Dust, all that remains of God, following the vapor wisp of the angel. And he knows they will meet very soon.</p><p>Elizabeth Bear was born on the same say as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, but in a different year.

It is to despise everybody.&#x2014;QUENTIN CRISP<br><br>At the corner of the window, a waxen spider spun.<br><br>Rien's trained eye noticed the spider, the way her spinning caught the light. But Rien did not move her rag to break the threads and sweep the cobweb down. She pressed to the wall between that window and the door and held her breath, praying like the spider that no eye would fall on her, as Lady Ariane Conn and her knights brought in the naked prisoner from Engine.<br><br>Rien knew the prisoner was of noble blood by her chains. They writhed at her wrists, quicksilver loops of nanotech. An ancient colony, costlier than rubies and more rare, but forestalling any untoward transformations.<br><br>Nobody would waste chains like that on a Mean when cheap extruded would serve. And then there was the way the prisoner bore herself, strong shameless steps that swept the nanotech across the floor behind like silken swags, and there was the buttermilk blue of her complexion.<br><br>The girl was tall, almost sexless in her slenderness and anything but sensual, though she was naked except for streaks of indigo blood, and dirt, and manacles. Her bony face was square, and tired sweat stuck her dirt-brown hair to her cheeks and shoulders. The only breadth on her, other than across the jaw and cheekbones, was in the wiry muscles of her shoulders and her chest. Even her bare feet were narrow and elegant.<br><br>Rien could not see the prisoner's hands through the twisting chains, but judged they must be the same. Furthermore, she was escorted in by a half-dozen of Ariane's knights, beam weapons slung across ablative armor carapaces, faces concealed under closed and tinted helms. The girl&#x2014;no older than Rien, though far more imposing&#x2014;was Family.<br><br>Rien drew back among the other upstairs maids, twisting her polishing cloth between her hands, but started when Head's hand fell on her. Rien craned her neck around, catching a comforting glimpse of Head's craggy profile, the long furrows beside hir nose, and whispered. "Will there be war?"<br><br>Head squeezed. The pain was a comfort. "When isn't there? Don't worry, girl. We're beneath soldiers. It never touches us."<br><br>Rien's mouth made an O. "Who's she then?"<br><br>Head's hand slid down Rien's sloping shoulder and brushed her elbow when it dropped. "That's Sir Perceval. They'll want her well fed once she's in her cell."<br><br>The chained girl's eyes swept the room like searchlights. Rien lowered her gaze when the stare seared over her.<br><br>Head cleared hir throat. "You can do it."<br><br>Care for the prisoner. Not a job for an upstairs maid. Not a job for a mere girl. "But&#x2014;"<br><br>"Hush," said Head.<br><br>And Rien had run clear of words anyway. For when the girl knight, Sir Perceval, passed&#x2014;back still straight as a dangled rope, chin lifted and eyes wide&#x2014;Rien saw what she had not before.<br><br>From long gashes between her shoulder blades, two azure ropes of blood groped down her back, across her spine. They writhed when they touched each other, like columns of searching ants.<br><br>Fruitlessly. The wings they sought had been severed at the root. And if Rien were to judge by the Lord's daughter Ariane striding beside the captive, her unblade bumping her thigh, the maiming would be permanent.<br><br>That sword's name was Innocence, and it was very old.<br><br>Rien raised her hand to her mouth and bit at the skin across the bones as the mangled demon of Engine was led through the hall, down the stair, and away.<br><br>At first Perceval thought the tickle in the hollow of her collarbone was the links of a silver necklace she always wore, kinking where they draped over bone. Then, as she came awake, she remembered that she was a prisoner of the House of Rule, and they had taken her necklace along with her clothes, so it must be a trailing strand of hair.<br><br>But she turned her head, and nothing slid across her nape and shoulders. They'd shaved her head&#x2014;one more humiliation, not remotely the worst.<br><br>Perceval's arms were chained over her head, and as her shifting weight fell against them, sensation briefly returned. The chains were not cold and hard, but had stretch and give, like oiled silk. Fighting them was like fighting the River, like a child wrestling adult power.<br><br>But she must fight anyway.<br><br>She bent her elbows, dragged at the bonds, tugged the sheets of nano that chained her feet to the floor. It hurt, though her weight was halved now, though her shoulders were shorn as naked as her scalp. Rule set the gravity high. Her muscles hardened reflexively, across her shoulders and her deep-keeled breast, and where translucent blood-warmed membrane should have cupped air, instead she felt the clean-cut rounds of bone twist in her new-scabbed wounds.<br><br>The tickle at her throat was a forlorn tendril of blood, still groping for the severed wing.<br><br>At least there was light here, light from a high window, falling warm and dusty across her scalp and shoulders. Perceval knew it was only to taunt, like the breeze that ghosted between the bars, but she found it a small mercy anyway. If she were to die, at least she would die in the sight of the suns, their strength soaking her bones.<br><br>She wrapped her fingers around the sheets of nano, straining to close numb hands, working her fists to move the blood inside. They came back to her in pins and needles, bursts of static along chastened nerves. The effort broke her scabs, and more blood ran from her wounds, dripped along her spine, outlined a buttock's curve. The blood was hotter than the sunlight.<br><br>She would not weep for her wings. She would not weep here at all. Not for anything.<br><br>She pulled at her chains again, and again, and only stopped when she heard the echo of a footstep on the star.<br><br>Rien came down spiraling polycarbonate steps, one elbow brushing the wall for balance as she steadied a tray on her hands. Sunlight falling through the stairs cast her shadow on the welded floor seven stories below. Her shoes tinkled on the high-impact plastic, the sound ringing back from roof and walls.<br><br>The prisoner would know that she was coming, which of course was the design.<br><br>At the bottom of the stair was an arched doorway into a short passage. There was no door, nor any need of one; no one who could escape nano chains would be forestalled by anything as fragile as a material barrier. Rien passed the locked and trapped controls and stepped through into the spacious, well-lit dungeon.<br><br>Perceval hung in her bonds like a marionette from a rack, head lolling and fingers limp. She did not stir when Rien entered, but Rien thought she saw the quick gleam of a flickering eye. "I've brought food," she said, and set the tray on a folding stand beside the door.<br><br>The food was quinoa porridge, steamed and sweetened with honey and soy milk, and a jug of peppermint tisane. Simple fare, but nourishing: the same breakfast Rien had partaken of, though colder now. Rien picked up the bowl, a transparent plastic spoon, and an absorbent shock-wove napkin and crossed the chamber to where the prisoner hung, silhouetted by falling light. "Lift up your head," Rien said, trying to sound stern. "I know that you're awake."<br><br>Fortunately, the bowl was durable. Because when the prisoner lifted up her head, blinked eyes the same color and transparency as the peppermint tea, and said, "Hello, Rien," Rien dropped it.<br><br>Dust closed his eyes and leaned back in a chair beside the conjured fire. Of course real fire was an impossibility here, a terror that would devour irreplaceable oxygen and fill airtight spaces with killing smoke, but the flicker and warmth and light of the programmed counterfeit would serve him, who was a counterfeit himself.<br><br>He put his feet up and listened to the downpour flooding the battlements. It rushed over polycarbonate-paned windows and poured out the rough-beaked snouts of precision-molded rain gutters, beaded on mossy outcrops, and thundered down the ragged shoulders of his house.<br><br>The sky creaked overhead. Somewhere deep in the bowels of the world, a conduit had broken. The unseasonable rain would continue until the world's blood healed the wound; Dust's anchore would be washed with water needed, no doubt, in far holdes and domaines. There was no sunlight in the core, except whatever reflected through the long-lensed and mirrored channels from the skin of the world, but there was water aplenty. Half the rivers in the world twisted across his sky.<br><br>He breathed the chill air, and smiled. The rain washing his house tickled his skin, the memory of a caress on skin that had not felt such a thing in centuries.<br><br>He had lost much of the world when he lost the rest of himself, but all that occurred here, he knew. He retained that, though he was not what he had been.<br><br>His ring caught on the placket as he tucked one hand into a white-and-silver brocaded waistcoat and felt for his watch. The chain fell cold and silver between his fingers, as if the rain ran through them, too.<br><br>When he raised it to his eye, he neither lifted his eyelid nor exposed the crystal. He did not need the watch, the glance, or the gesture. He knew the time; it ticked out within him with atomic regularity. But the ceremony pleased him nonetheless.<br><br>"Nearing midnight," he said to an empty chamber, voice ringing on stone walls and hushed by hand-knotted carpets. Dust sat upright, opening his eyes, tucking his watch away. White sleeves billowed as he stood and walked to the window, where a watery light struggled: the reflected suns' doomed but valiant attempt to shine through the sheeting water.<br><br>"All but midnight already," he said, and streaked the condensation on the plastic with a casual finger. The house rubbed into his caress. "And so much to be done."<br><br>With a magician's gesture, he plucked a glass of brandy from the air, swirling the liquor under his nose. It smelled sharply of real rain&#x2014;as the rain could not&#x2014;and chocolate, atomized molecules tickling his receptors, and he smiled when he tasted it.<br><br>He spoke to the rain as if through it the world could hear him, though he knew the world had gone deaf long before. But memory was what he had, memory and ritual, and a flair for the melodramatic honed through centuries of study.<br><br>"By the elements, by the ten directions. I have not forgotten. My name is Jacob Dust, and I have not forgotten."<br><br>Dust could see through the rain if he chose to, stretch out his senses to the skin of the world. He could attenuate himself, reach broad, grow into mist and brush as if with invisible fingertips the transparent skin of the world, reach out beyond it, into the cold empty darkness beyond, where the light of the stars and the temporary suns burned. He could stroke the vast cratered hide, its twisted sun-shades and solar panels, the old wounds and injuries that there simply were not resources to repair. He could reach out into many the holdes and anchores and domaines, into the chambers and vaults of the world. If he were not prevented, in places, he could have extended that reach into its long-cold engines and rent reactor cores, through the homes of Mean and noble alike, into the courts of Engine and Rule. But not all paths were open; some of them his brothers watched over jealously.<br><br>He could, however, stroke the cheek of an exiled prince, and of a princess who would be Captain, and of Perceval in her dungeon chains.<br><br>And only the angels would know.<br><br>But world was vast, and vastly broken, limping in its desolate orbit around these shipwreck stars. And Jacob Dust was not what he had been, when he and the world were whole. He could do these things, if he chose to. But the effort would exhaust him. And there were those to whom he could not risk being made vulnerable.<br><br>Not yet.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br>They know all, that dwell in the silent kitchens<br></i><br>In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.&#x2014;JOHN 14:2, King James Bible<br><br>Some of the milk and porridge splashed out when Rien dropped the bowl. It spattered Perceval's ankle, and her chains writhed toward it, defensively. But once they tasted the spill, they withdrew again&#x2014;Perceval could not help but think&#x2014;nonplussed.<br><br>"I'm sorry," she said. "I did not mean to startle you. Was that for me, Rien?"<br><br>The girl stammered, staring. She was small, fine-boned, with delicate features and a wild froth of frizzy black hair chopped off shoulder-long and clipped back with jeweled plastic spiders that spun a transparent hairnet between them&#x2014;something cheap and pretty.<br><br>She looked nothing like her mother, but then, who did?<br><br>"It is for you," she managed, bending down to pick up the bowl. It hadn't overturned.<br><br>She picked the spoon off the floor as well, and scrubbed it on the hem of her tan blouse. As if a little dirt from the dungeon floor could discomfit Perceval now.<br><br>When Rien looked up again, Perceval spread her hands, a gesture of helplessness. She could not feed herself bound up in chains, the strain like dripped fire down her neck and shoulders, a hurt even sharper than the missing wings. Ariane Conn, Perceval promised herself, feeling a little ridiculous. She could say the name a thousand times. It would not free her, nor put her in a place where she could fight Lady Ariane.<br><br>And in any case, Ariane was the eldest living and acknowledged daughter of Alasdair Conn, who had been Commodore since the death of the last Captain. Nearly five hundred years, nearly since the moving times. She was out of Perceval's league.<br><br>Except here unlooked-for was the child Rien, sent to serve Perceval in her captivity, apparently in all innocence. An Engineer's miracle. It might mean that even somewhere here in Rule there was a friend.<br><br>Perceval arched up on the balls of her feet to ease her arms and shoulders as Rien fussed with the spoon.<br><br>"I will feed you," Rien said, as if noticing Perceval's gesture. She dug the spoon through porridge and held it up so Perceval had only to push her chin forward to take it.<br><br>Of course the stuff might be drugged, but they had her in nanochains. If they wanted to poison her, or kill her, or interrogate her, there were easier means.<br><br>And Perceval had no doubt those means would be used.<br><br>Even such a small motion made her want to gasp in pain, though she schooled herself to let only a little air hiss from her nose. Rien noticed, however, and after Perceval had her mouthful, Rien walked around her to examine her back.</p><h2>The New Worship: Straight Talk on Music and the Church</h2><p>Shows pastors how to balance new worship ideas with the traditional while focusing on the purpose of praise and fellowship.</p><p><b>Changing your worship service doesn't have to be a nightmare.<br><br></b>It <i>is</i> possible to introduce new worship ideas in a way that your congregation, both young and old, can accept. <i>The New Worship, </i>revised and expanded, shows everyone involved in music and worship planning how to smoothly navigate the changes.

Fearing cremation, she extracted from her family the promise to bury her after she died. This was in Xian, a city in central China, in the 1970s, when a national ban on all traditional Chinese practices, including burials, was strictly enforced. But Huang&#x2019;s grandmother was persistent, and two years later, his father built her a coffin. He also appointed his older son, Wenguang, as coffin keeper, a distinction that meant, among other things, sleeping next to the coffin at night.<br><br>Over the next fifteen years, the whole family was consumed with planning Grandma&#x2019;s burial, a regular source of friction and contention, with the constant risk of being caught by the authorities. Many years after her death, the family&#x2019;s memories of her coffin still loom large. Huang, now living and working in America, has come to realize how much the concern over the coffin has affected his upbringing and shaped the lives of everyone in the family.

However, we have lost the very human sense of place in today&#39;s postmodern and globalized world. Craig Bartholomew, a noted Old Testament scholar and the co-author of two popular texts on the biblical narrative, provides a biblical, theological, and philosophical grounding for place in our rootless culture. He illuminates the importance of place throughout the biblical canon, in the Christian tradition, and in the contours of contemporary thought. Bartholomew encourages readers to recover a sense of place and articulates a hopeful Christian vision of placemaking in today&#39;s world. Anyone interested in place and related environmental themes, including readers of Wendell Berry, will enjoy this compelling book.</p><p><b>A Hopeful Christian Vision of Placemaking<br></b><br>"A unique book.

Most experts, known in this very specific area of scholarship as Ripperologists, believe that the fiend committed his atrocities during a relatively short period of time in 1888, yet his sobriquet still resonates throughout the world today.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is reasonable to ask why this remains true after more than a century and a quarter. Certainly, there have been countless other killers whose names have screamed at us in headlines over the years, holding our attention for a while before fading and, mostly, disappearing.<br> &nbsp;<br> We may remember Adam Lanza now, for having committed the incomprehensible slaughter of twenty children and six adults at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, but only devoted scholars of crime will recall Andrew Kehoe, who murdered thirty-eight children and five adults when he blew up a school in Michigan in 1927.<br> &nbsp;<br> American gangsters such as Al Capone, Bonnie and Clyde, Whitey Bulger, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, and John Gotti are legendary figures in America but are virtually unknown in the rest of the world. The same is largely true for the icons of the old Western frontier, where Jesse James, Billy the Kid, the Younger brothers, and Doc Holliday became the subject of purple prose newspaper accounts that captivated East Coast readers, leading to dime novels and motion picture portrayals that reimagined vicious thugs as semi-heroic characters. None of these villains sends a chill down the spine, as popular media have sanitized their reputations and deeds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Equally uninspiring of horror in the present time are British killers such as Fred and Rose West, who are known to have tortured and murdered at least eleven women and girls until they were brought to trial in 1994, their exploits garishly recounted in the news media. Also the merest footnote to the history of serial killers is Dr. Harold Shipman, reputedly the murderer of approximately two hundred and fifty people, mostly his patients, whose wills he forged so that he could inherit their valuables. Some may recall the newspapers&#x2019; colorful title of the Moors Murderers, but few remember the real names of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, described at her trial as the Most Evil Woman in Britain. Other names that became famous at one time, mainly because they became the subjects of books or movies, are Burke and Hare, gravediggers who were paid for corpses for medical examination and soon found it easier to kill people than dig them up; Constance Kent, who murdered a child when she was sixteen, a case so notorious in its time (1860) that elements were used by Wilkie Collins in <i>The Moonstone</i>, by Charles Dickens in <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, and in numerous other novels; Peter William Sutcliffe, better known as the Yorkshire Ripper, convicted of murdering thirteen women; and Madeleine Smith, whose trial for poisoning her lover allowed her freedom when the jury returned a verdict of &#x201c;not proven.&#x201d; She was sensationalized in Wilkie Collins&#x2019;s <i>The Law and the Lady</i> and in the 1950 David Lean film <i>Madeleine</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Better known in the United States, often because journalists bestowed colorful names on them, are such infamous serial killers as The Hillside Stranglers, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono; the Son of Sam, David Berkowitz; the Co-ed Killer, Edmund Kemper; the BTK (Bind, Torture, and Kill) Killer, Dennis Rader; the Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez; the Milwaukee Cannibal, Jeffrey Dahmer; the Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway; John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy, prolific murderers who somehow eluded colorful titles; and Charles Manson, probably the most fearsome American psychopath of the twentieth century, his crimes splashed along headlines for years, partially because of the unspeakable brutality of the crimes and partially because of the fame and beauty of one of the victims, Sharon Tate.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a seemingly limitless number of people who have committed untold numbers of hei-nous acts throughout the long history of Homo sapiens, a species almost unique in its ability to kill within the species for the sheer pleasure of it. With so many others having murdered in even greater numbers than Jack the Ripper, and some equally brutal (or worse, engaging in unspeak-ably depraved torture of living victims, a practice almost entirely eschewed by Saucy Jack), why does he continue to maintain his place at the top of the public&#x2019;s radar?<br> &nbsp;<br> While students of criminology are not unanimous in attributing the number of the Ripper&#x2019;s victims, with five apparently accepted universally, but one, two, three, or four others also credited to him by various scholars, it is generally agreed that all the murders occurred during the autumn of 1888 (again, with outliers claiming at least an additional year at either end). The victims were all prostitutes in London&#x2019;s East End, a ghetto teeming with the poorest segment of the population. The dark, narrow alleyways, often ending in cul-de-sacs, were perfect venues in which to commit an act of violence&#x2014;or a transaction of a sexual nature, performed by a member of the largest profession of the neighborhood. The noxious fumes of coal stoves and fireplaces, as well as the factories located in the area, combined to provide an almost permanently darkened sky, a smog known as London particular. The women of the night, prowling the streets, looking for partners to pay them enough for a glass of warming gin, were perfect victims, willing&#x2014;no, eager&#x2014;to slip off to a darkened corner to quickly ply their trade. Although police patrolled regularly throughout the night, it was seldom the cream of the force, and the odds of them catching a criminal in the act, with visibility frequently limited to two or three feet, were slim.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since so few cared about the victims of the Ripper&#x2019;s carnage while they were alive, why has their fate continued to resonate today? A likely reason is that he was never caught. Having spread a tsunami of terror for a short time, he disappeared completely, leaving his identity to be theorized, discussed, argued, and written about for decade after decade. It did not hurt his legacy of notoriety that he frequently taunted the police, with the complicity of the local press, by sending letters warning them of forthcoming attacks and daring them to catch him if they can.<br> &nbsp;<br> The frisson of terror evoked by his name, Jack the Ripper&#x2014;so much more chilling than merely Jack the Killer or Jack the Stabber&#x2014;stays in the memory, and on the tongue, so easily. He was written about in such extreme terms, first of course in newspapers, but then in magazine articles and books, that he provided endless fodder for those who became intrigued by him. Theories about his identity were rampant, with clues clutched to advance one theory, while other possible pieces of evidence were ignored if they suggested that someone else was the genuine article. Other Ripperologists rushed to discredit the first theory and advance their own, which suffered the same fate at the hands of still other students of the crimes. Jack the Ripper has now been &#x201c;proven&#x201d; to be any one of at least a half-dozen people by various authors and scholars.<br> &nbsp;<br> This collection has articles describing the area of the atrocities, accounts of the murders, and theories about the identity of Red Jack by some of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on the subject.<br> There also are contemporary reports from newspapers of the day. Taken together, they will provide a reasonably clear picture of the real-life events that inspired so much fiction about the incidents and the demented individual at the heart of them. For the most comprehensive guide to all the facts, if you are interested to read in far greater detail than offered here, I recommend The Complete Jack the Ripper by Donald Rumbelow.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fiction contained in this tome has a wide range. While planned as a volume of crime stories, the almost mythical level at which Jack has been perceived has compelled me to include some of the memorable tales that present him as ageless as his reputation. Many theories about why Jack quit so abruptly have suggested he moved to a different country, or to a different time. It was impossible to resist these stories by several masters of the form.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, proving yet again that Jack the Ripper is as timeless as fear, there are new stories, written especially for this volume by some of today&#x2019;s most distinguished authors&#x2014;Jeffery Deaver, Loren D. Estleman, Lyndsay Faye, Stephen Hunter, Anne Perry, and Daniel Stashower&#x2014;and I am grateful to them all for adding to the literature about one of the most singularly vile creatures ever to degrade the planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prepare to be unnerved.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Otto Penzler</p><h2>Tales of the Dominion War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)</h2><p>For two seasons, <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine�</i> chronicled the intense struggle of the Federation, fighting alongside the Klingons and the Romulans against the overwhelming forces of the Dominion in some of the most exciting hours of television ever produced. <br> Now, for the first time, see how the Dominion War affected the entirety of the Star Trek universe.

It could be Kirk's <i>Enterprise</i> or Picard's <i>Enterprise</i> (or, if you wanted to get radical, possibly Pike's <i>Enterprise,</i> April's <i>Enterprise,</i> or Garrett's <i>Enterprise),</i> but for twenty-seven years, it was the <i>Enterprise</i> that was always at the forefront of most any <i>Star Trek</i> adventure.<br><br>Then in January 1993, <i>DS9</i> debuted, taking place on a space station, featuring a cast that was only about half Starfleet -- and the floodgates opened. Now, the whole <i>Star Trek</i> universe was fair game. <i>Star Trek</i> was no longer limited to one ship. The storytelling possibilities, already pretty wide with a ship of exploration at its center, got even wider.<br><br>This extended not only to television, but also to the <i>Star Trek</i> novels, which have been, in one form or other, an integral part of the franchise since <i>Mission to Horatius</i> was published back in 1968. In 1997, <i>Star Trek:</i> New Frontier debuted, with Peter David chronicling the adventures of an all-new ship and crew created just for the novels -- something that wouldn't have been imaginable before <i>DS9.</i> The success of <i>New Frontier</i> in turn led to more prose-only projects: <i>Star Trek: Stargazer</i> by Michael Jan Friedman, showcasing a young Jean-Luc Picard in his first command three decades prior to <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation; Star Trek: S.C.E.,</i> a monthly series of eBooks by a variety of authors featuring the Starfleet Corps of Engineers; and my own <i>Star Trek: I.K.S. Gorkon,</i> focusing on a vessel in the Klingon Defense Force.<br><br>"This," you may say, "is all well and good, but what does it have to do with this anthology?" A fair question.<br><br>The Dominion War was a massive endeavor, one that involved the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Cardassians, the Dominion, and so much more. But <i>DS9</i> was really only able to show a small portion of it. Just as <i>M A S H</i> showed the Korean War through the lens of one particular group of characters and one general location, <i>DS9</i> likewise gave us a view of the Dominion War. But it's not the complete picture of the whole conflict.<br><br>That's where <i>Tales of the Dominion War</i> comes in. I love the opening up of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe because I love to explore all the nooks and crannies, the roads not traveled as often, expanding on the bits that are talked about but not shown. With the war, I found myself asking many questions. Some previous novels and eBooks had dealt with the conflict to some degree or other (see the timeline at the back of this volume), but I was still left wondering: What was Picard's <i>Enterprise</i> doing? What about the original series characters Spock, McCoy, and Scotty, all of whom are still alive and kicking in the late twenty-fourth century? What about the <i>Excalibur</i> crew from <i>New Frontier</i> or the <i>da Vinci</i> crew from <i>S.C.E.</i> or Klag from the <i>Gorkon?</i> What about the surviving crew of the <i>Stargazer?</i> How was it that Shinzon served the Romulan Empire with distinction during the war, as established in <i>Star Trek Nemesis?</i> And what about the events that were mentioned on <i>DS9</i> but not dramatized, such as the fall of Betazed from "In the Pale Moonlight" or the Breen attack on Earth in "The Changing Face of Evil"?<br><br>And so I gathered some of the best <i>Trek</i> prose stylists out there, and set them to the task of sewing some new threads in the tapestry that <i>DS9</i> provided. Some pairings of author and subject were obvious, e.g., Peter David providing a <i>New Frontier</i> tale, Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz -- authors of several excellent novels focusing on Ambassador Spock -- offering an insight into Spock's doings on Romulus during the war years, etc. Some will surprise you; I, for example, chose, for reasons of my own, to tell the story of the fall of Betazed, leaving the able Robert Greenberger to dramatize Klag's adventures. Other authors I just let run loose and tell whatever story they wanted.<br><br>The result is the book you hold in your hands, one that endeavors to show the <i>entirety</i> of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe. All five television shows are at least touched upon, as are all the above-mentioned prose series. You will see the war from the point of view, not only of Starfleet, but of the Klingons and the Romulans, the Cardassians and the Jem'Hadar, and even that old <i>Star Trek</i> standby, a being of pure energy. Within these pages are battles, disasters, fables, medical thrillers, espionage tales, murder mysteries, and so much more.<br><br>I must give thanks to the many people who aided me in ushering this book into existence: Jessica McGivney and Elisa Kassin, the in-house editors, who kept the mills grinding. Scott Shannon, the publisher who oversaw those mills. Marco Palmieri, John J. Ordover, and Ed Schlesinger, who kibbitzed marvelously at various points. All the authors, who were true joys to work with, and who were all very patient with their deadbeat editor. Paula M. Block, the wonderful person at Paramount who approves all this stuff, and does so with a keen eye, a fine sensibility, and a marvelous ability to catch things the rest of us are too dumb to notice. And most of all, to the love of my life Terri Osborne, about whom I can't say enough good things, so I won't even try to say them all here.<br><br>And now, to the front lines...<br><br> -- Keith R.A.

Through visits to battlefields and memorials, Geoff Dyer examines the way that photographs and film, poetry and prose determined&#x2014;sometimes in advance of the events described&#x2014;the way we would think about and remember the war. With his characteristic originality and insight, Dyer untangles and reconstructs the network of myth and memory that illuminates our understanding of, and relationship to, the Great War.</p></p><p><p>A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Geoff Dyer has received the Somerset Maugham Award, the E. M. Forster Award, a Lannan Literary Fellowship, a National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism, and, in 2015, the Windham Campbell Prize for non-fiction. The author of four novels and nine works of non-fiction, Dyer is writer in residence at the University of Southern California and lives in Los Angeles. His books have been translated into twenty-four languages.<br><br></p><i>'On every mantelpiece stand photographs wreathed with ivy, smiling, true to the past . . .'<br></i>Dusty, bulging, old: they are all the same, these albums. The same faces, the same photos. Every family was touched by the war and every family has an album like this. Even as we prepare to open it, the act of looking at the album is overlaid by the emotions it will engender. We look at the pictures as if reading a poem about the experience of seeing them.<br><br>I turn the dark, heavy pages. The dust smell of old photographs. <br><br>The dead queuing up to enlist. Marching through the dark town, disappearing beyond the edge of the frame. Some turn up later, in the photos from hospital: marching away and convalescing, nothing in between. Always close to hand, the countryside seems empty in these later pictures, a register of absence. Dry stone walls and rivers. Portraits and group portraits. Officers and other ranks. The loved and the unloved, indistinguishable from each other. <br><br>'Memory has a spottiness,' writes Updike, 'as if the film was sprinkled with developer instead of immersed in it.' Each of these photos is marred, spotted, blotched; their imperfections make them seem like photos of memories. In some there is an encroaching white light, creeping over the image, wiping it out. Others are fading: photos of forgetting. Eventually nothing will remain but blank spaces.<br><br>A nurse in round glasses and long uniform ('Myself' printed beneath in my grandmother's perfect hand). A group of men in hospital. Two with patches over their eyes, three with arms in slings. One<br><br>in his ghastly suit of grey,<br>Legless, sewn short at the elbow.<br><br>A stern-faced sister stands at the end of the back row, each name diligently inked beneath the picture. My mother's father is the second on the left, in the back row.<br><br>Born (illegitimate) in Worthen in Shropshire, eighteen miles from Oswestry where Wilfred Owen was born. Farm labourer. Able only to read and write his name. Enlisted in 1914. Served on the Somme as a driver (of horses), where, according to family legend, he once went up to the front-line trenches in place of a friend whose courage had suddenly deserted him. Later, back in the reserve trench, he shovelled the remains of his best friend into a sandbag. (Every family has the same album, every family has a version of the same legend.) Returned to Shropshire in 1919 and resumed the life he had left.<br><br>Worked, went to war, married, worked.<br><br>He died aged ninety-one, able still only to write his name. Everything I have said about my grandfather is true. Except he is not the man second from the left in the photograph. I do no know who that is. It makes no difference. He could be anyone's grandfather.<br><br>Like many young men, my grandfather was under age when he turned up to enlist. The recruiting sergeant told him to come back in a couple of days when he was two years older. My grandfather duly returned, added a couple of years to his age and was accepted into the army.<br><br>Similar episodes are fairly common in the repertoire of recruitment anecdotes, but I never doubted the veracity of this particular version of it, which my mother told several times over the years. It came as a surprise, then, to discover from his death certificate that my grandfather was born in November 1893 (the same year as Owen), and so was twenty years when war broke out. One of the commonly circulating stories of the 1914 generation had been so thoroughly absorbed by my family that it had become part of my grandfather's biography.<br><br>He is everyone's grandfather.<br><br>*<br><br>Seven-thirty a.m. Mist lies over the fields of the Somme. Trees are smudged shapes. Nothing moves. Power lines sag and vanish over absent hedges. Birds call invisibly. Only the road can be sure of where it is going. <br><br>I stop for breakfast &#x2014; an apple, a banana, yoghurt slurped from the carton &#x2014; and consult the map I bought yesterday. A friend who was driving from Paris to catch a dawn ferry at Calais had given me a lift to Amiens. From there I hitched in the direction of Albert because, from my newly acquired map, it was the nearest station to the villages whose names I vaguely recognize: Beaumont-Hamel, Mametz, Pozi�res . . . I want to visit the cemeteries of the Somme but have no clear idea of what they are like or which ones are particularly worth visiting. On my map, near Thiepval, is printed in heavy type: 'Memorial Brit.' When I began hitching this morning, I did not know what I would find or where I would go &#x2014; I still don't, except that at some point in the day I will visit Thiepval. For now I cram everything back in my rucksack and continue walking.<br><br>Within an hour, exactly as forecast, the mist starts to thin. Level slopes of fields appear. The dusty blaze of rape. Dipping flatness. I walk towards a large cemetery, the most distant rows of headstones barely visible.<br><br>The cemetery is separated from the surrounding field by a low wall, dissolved in places by the linger of mist. Close to this wall a large cross appears as a mossy blur, like the trunk of a tree. The noise of the gate being unlatched sends birds flocking from branches and back. The gravel is loud beneath my feet. Near the gate, on a large stone &#x2014; pale, horizontal, altar-like &#x2014; is written:<br><br>THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE<br><br>Between this stone and the cross are rows of white headstones, bordered by perfect grass. Flowers: purple, dull red, flame-yellow.<br><br>Most of the headstones give simply the regiment, name, rank and, where it is known, the date of the soldier's death, sometimes his age. Occasionally quotations have been added, but the elaborate biblical sentiments are superfluous; they neither add to nor detract from the uniform pathos of the headstones, some of which do not even bear a name:<br><br>A SOLDIER<br>OF THE GREAT WAR<br>KNOWN UNTO GOD<br><br>The cross has a bronze sword running down the centre, pointing to the ground. Gradually the mist thins enough for the cross to cast a promise of shadow, a darker haze, so faint it is barely there. Pale sunlight.<br><br>The high left-hand wall of the cemetery is a memorial to the New Zealand dead with no known graves 'who fell in the Battles of the Somme September and October 1916'. Inscribed along its length are 1,205 names. <br><br>Near the gate is a visitors' book and register of graves. The name of the cemetery is Caterpillar Valley. There are 5,539 men buried here.<br><i>'We will remember them'<br></i>The Great War ruptured the historical continuum, destroying the legacy of the past. Wyndham Lewis sounds the characteristic note when he calls it 'the turning-point in the history of the earth', but there is a sense in which, for the British at least, the war helped to preserve the past even as it destroyed it. Life in the decade and a half preceding 1914 has come to be viewed inevitably and unavoidably through the optic of the war that followed it. The past <i>as past</i> was preserved by the war that shattered it. By ushering in a future characterized by instability and uncertainty, it embalmed for ever a past characterized by stability and certainty.<br><br>Things were, of course, less settled than the habitual view of pre-August 1914 tempts us to believe. For many contemporary observers the war tainted the past, revealing and making explicit a violence that had been latent in the preceding peace. Eighty years on, this sense of crouched and gathering violence has been all but totally filtered out of our perception of the pre-war period. Militant suffragettes, class unrest, strikes, Ireland teetering on the brink of civil war &#x2014; all are shaded and softened by the long, elegiac shadows cast by the war.<br><br>European civilization may have been 'breaking down even before war destroyed it', but our abiding sense of the quietness of the Edwardian frame of mind is, overwhelmingly, derived from and enhanced by the holocaust that followed it. The glorious summer of 1914 seems, even, to have been generated by the cataclysm that succeeded it. <br><br>In a persuasive passage, Johan Huizinga admonished the historian to <br><br>maintain towards his subject an indeterminist point of view. He must constantly put himself at a point in the past at which the known factors still seem to permit different outcomes.<br><br>But history does not lie uniformly over events. Here and there in forms drifts &#x2014; and these drifts are at their deepest between the years 1914 and1918. Watching footage of the Normandy landings, we can experience D-Day <i>as it happened</i>. History hangs in the balance, waiting to be made. The Battle of the Somme, by contrast, is deeply buried in its own aftermath. The euphoric intoxication of the early days of the French Revolution &#x2014; 'Bliss was it in that dawn' &#x2014; remains undiminished by the terror lying in wait a few chapters on. The young men queuing up to enlist in 1914 have the look of ghosts. They are queuing up to be slaughtered: they are already dead. By Huizinga's terms, the Great War urges us to write the opposite of history: the story of effects generating their cause.<br><i>They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:<br>Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>We will remember them.<br><br></i>These incantatory rhythms and mantra-like repetitions are intoned every year on Remembrance Day. They are words we hear but rarely see in print. We known them &#x2014; more or less &#x2014; by heart. They seem not to have been written but to have pulsed into life in the nation's collective memory, to have been generated, down the long passage of years, by the hypnotic spell of Remembrance they are used to induce.<br><br>But they <i>were </i>written, of course, by Laurence Binyon, in September 1914: <i>before</i> the fallen actually fell. 'For the Fallen', in other words, is a work not of remembrance but of anticipation, or more accurately, the <i>anticipation of remembrance</i>: a foreseeing that is also a determining.<br><br>On 22 August 1917 at Pilkem Ridge near Ypres, Ernest Brooks took one of the iconographic photographs of the Great War. Head bowed, rifle on his back, a soldier is silhouetted against the going down of the sun, looking at the grave of a dead comrade, remembering him. A photograph from the war &#x2014; the Battle of Third Ypres (or Passchendaele as it is better known) was still raging, the armistice was fifteen months distant &#x2014; it is also a photograph of the way the war will come to be remembered. It is a photograph of the future, of the future's great view of the past. It is a photograph of Binyon's poem, of a sentiment. We<i> will </i>remember them.<br>If several of the terms by which we remember the war were established in advance of its conclusion, many crucial elements were embodied in a single dramatic event two years before it started. <br><br>Between November 1911 and January 1912 two teams of men &#x2014; one British, headed by a naval officer, Robert Falcon Scott, the other Norwegian, headed by Roald Amundsen &#x2014; were engaged in the last stage of a protracted race to the South Pole. Using dogs and adapting themselves skilfully to the hostile environment, the Norwegian team reached the pole on 15 December and returned safely. Scott, leader of an ill-prepared expedition which relied on strength-sapping man-hauling, reached the Pole on 17 January. Defeated, the five-man team faced a gruelling 800-mile trudge back to safety. By 21 March, eleven miles from the nearest depot of food and fuel, the three exhausted surviving members of the expedition &#x2014; Scott, Dr Edward Wilson and Henry Bowers &#x2014; pitched their tent and sat out a blizzard. At some point Scott seems to have made the decision that it was better to stay put and preserve the record of their struggle rather than die in their tracks. They survived for at least nine days while Scott, in Roland Huntford's phrase 'prepared his exit from the stage' and addressed letters to posterity: 'We are setting a good example to our countrymen, if not by getting into a tight place, by facing it like men when we get there.' Despite its failure, the expedition, wrote Scott, 'has shown that Englishmen can endure hardships, help one another and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past'. The tradition of heroic death which aggrandizes his own example is also invigorated by it: 'We are showing that Englishman can still die with a bold spirit, fighting it out to the end . . . I think this makes an example for Englishmen of the future.'<br><br>On 12 November, in the collapsed tent, the bodies and their documents were found by a rescue party and the legend of Scott of the Antarctic began to take immediate effect. 'Of their suffering, hardship and devotion to one another,' wrote a member of the rescue team, 'the world will soon know the deeds that were done were equally as great as any committed on Battlefield and won the respect and honour of every true Britisher.'</p><h2>A Daily Word: 366 Scriptural Devotions for Growing Christians</h2><p>Designed to compliment your daily devotional walk with the Lord, this new book from Dr. Paul Chappell features 366 daily devotional thoughts to strengthen and encourage your spiritual life.

Although he saw himself chiefly as a poet, publishing a number of books of poetry, he also left behind a sparkling comic novel, four children's books, numerous translations, haunting letters, and four collections of essays. Edited by Brad Leithauser, <em>No Other Book</em>draws from these four essay collections, reminding us that Jarell the poet was also, in the words of Robert Lowell, "a critic of genius."</p><p>"Most critics," Randall Jarrell wrote in a 1952 essay, "are so domesticated as to seem institutions--as they stand there between reader and writer, so different from either, they remind one of the Wall standing between Pyramus and Thisbe." His complaint was as accurate then as it is now. Yet Jarrell himself had nothing of the literary obstructionist to him. The essays he wrote over the course of three decades--in which he mingled his assessments of poetry and prose with the occasional <i>cri de coeur</i> over the state of American civilization--always escort the reader directly into the inner sanctum of the work at hand. And they do so with such scintillating, comical brilliance that most other criticism seems to pale into testy insignificance. We should be grateful, then, that Brad Leithauser has assembled <i>No Other Book</i>, which returns to print many of Jarrell's imperishable picks and pans.<p> Jarrell's slash-and-burn style caused a certain discomfort among his fellow poets, particularly those who fell short of his sky-high standards. And indeed, his inspired jabs have lost little of their pungency or amusement: Oscar Williams's poetry, for example, "gave the impression of having been written on a typewriter by a typewriter." Even Walt Whitman, whose reputation Jarrell single-handedly repaired, gets the occasional spanking. </p><blockquote> Only a man with the most extraordinary feel for language, or none whatsoever, could have cooked up Whitman's worst messes. For instance: what other man in all the history of this planet would have said, "I am a habitant of Vienna"? (One has an immediate vision of him as a sort of French Canadian halfbreed to whom the Viennese are offering, with trepidation, through the bars of a zoological garden, little mounds of whipped cream.) </blockquote> A master of the sublime putdown, Jarrell was even more masterful when it came to praise: his essays on Whitman, Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens permanently changed the way we read these poets. He also functioned as a early-warning system for his own generation and the one to follow--who else was sufficiently prescient to pick out Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, and Adrienne Rich as front-runners? And unlike his New Critical contemporaries, Jarrell never made the mistake of divorcing life from art. His comment on Frost's poetry applies equally to his own productions: "How little they seem performances, no matter how brilliant or magical, how little things made primarily of words (or of ink and paper, either), and how much things made out of lives and the world that lives inhabit." No other poet has ever written about his art with such electricity and intelligence--which makes <i>No Other Book</i> one of the true treasures of this or any other year. <i>--James Marcus</i>Randall Jarrell (1914-1965) received the National Book Award for his book of poems <em>The Woman at the Washington Zoo.</em> His children's book <em>The Animal Family</em> was named a Newbery Honor Book, and his translation of <em>The Three Sisters</em> was produced by The Actors Studio Theatre.</p><h2>Virginia Plantation Homes</h2><p><p>David King Gleason provides a grand tour of Virginia&#x2019;s distinctive plantation homes. As the architectural historian Calder Loth states in his prefatory note, &#x201c;Gleason&#x2019;s elegant photographs provide a seductive image of life in &#x2018;Old Virginia.&#x2019; He presents one inviting house after another, complete with handsome interiors, and spacious grounds dotted with boxwoods and venerable trees.&#x201d;</p><p>Unlike those in the Deep South, most of Virginia&#x2019;s plantation homes were built before the antebellum period and mainly reflect colonial, English Georgian, and Jeffersonian styles of architecture. Gleason has photographed the homes in all seasons, framing some in the pink blossoms of springtime dogwoods, showing others surrounded by the golden hues of autumn, and presenting still others blanketed in January snows. Many of the photographs provide aerial perspectives that encompass not only the homes themselves but outbuildings and dependencies, great lawns and terraced gardens.</p><p>The book begins with homes in the Tidewater region, where Bacon&#x2019;s Castle, built in 1665 on the south bank of the James River, still stands. It is the oldest surviving house not only in Virginia but in all of English-settled North America. Other houses from the Tidewater region include Westover, considered one of the most beautiful Georgian residences in the United States; Brandon, at one time the home of Benjamin Harrison; Appomattox Manor, where Ulysses S. Grant headquartered for a period during the Civil War; and Carter&#x2019;s Grove, near Williamsburg. In northern Virginia and the Shenandoah valley are Gunston Hall, near Alexandria; Woodlawn, in Fairfax County; Washington&#x2019;s Mount Vernon; and Melrose, a castellated manor inspired by the romantic literature of Sir Walter Scott. In the Piedmont, Gleason photographed such houses as Ash Lawn, the home of James Monroe; Edgemont, an exquisitely proportioned house showing Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s influence; and Estouteville, whose great center hall opens onto identical Tuscan porticos framing magnificent views of the Virginia countryside. Gleason&#x2019;s photographs of a mist-shrouded Monticello are among the most beautiful in the book.</p><p> In all, Gleason has photographed more than eighty of Virginia&#x2019;s finest plantation homes. Extensive captions provide concise histories of each house, including its original builder and subsequent owners, and its occupants, either friendly or hostile, during the Revolutionary or Civil wars.</p></p><p>David King Gleason was a photographer who lived and worked in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His other books include <i>Plantation Homes of Louisiana and the Natchez Area, Over New Orleans, Over Boston, Over Miami,</i> and <i>Atlanta.</i></p><h2>Taking the Risk Out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda versus Freedom and Liberty (The History of Media and Communication)</h2><p>This item condition is New.

Martinez was on a routine patrol when the Humvee he was driving hit an antitank mine in Iraq, resulting in severe injuries and burns on his face and more than one-third of his body. Out of that tragedy came an improbable journey of inspiration, motivation, and dreams come true. In <i>Full of Heart</i>, Martinez shares his story in intimate detail, from his upbringing in the American South and his time in the Army to his recovery and the indomitable spirit that has made him an inspiration to countless fans.<br><br>J.R. Martinez always had a strong spirit. Raised in Bossier City, Louisiana, and then Hope, Arkansas, by a single mother from El Salvador, he was well known at school for his good looks and his smart mouth. At seventeen, showing an early determination and drive that would become one of his trademark qualities, J.R. convinced his mom to move to Dalton, Georgia, where he believed he would have a better chance of being recruited to play college football. His positive attitude earned him a spot on a competitive high school football squad, but when his college dreams collapsed, he turned to the U.S. Army. A few months later, he found himself serving in Iraq.<br><br>When J.R.&#x2019;s humvee hit a mine and exploded&#x2014;just one month into his deployment&#x2014;he was immediately evacuated to a San Antonio medical center, where he spent the next thirty-four months in grueling recovery. Seeing his disfigured face for the first time after the accident threw him into a crushing period of confusion and anger. His spirits were low, until he was asked to speak to another young burn victim. J.R. realized how valuable and gratifying it was to share his experiences with other patients and listen to theirs. He&#x2019;d found a calling.<br><br>His fellow soldiers, along with the local and then national media, soon latched onto J.R.&#x2019;s spirit and strength. His resilience, optimism, and charm were also noted by Hollywood and scored him roles on <i>All My Children</i> and <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, where he was the season thirteen champion. <br><br>Today, J.R. tours the country sharing his story and his lessons for overcoming challenges and embracing hope, lessons that abound in this book.<em> Full of Heart</em> is an unforgettable story of a man who never gave up on his dreams.<br> <br>After being injured in Iraq, J.R.

The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would<br>mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker. <br><br>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk&#x2014;under the circumstances. <br><br>Ullman had asked a question he hadn&#x2019;t caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there&#x2019;s your son, of course.&#x201d; He glanced down at the application in front of him. &#x201c;Daniel. Your wife isn&#x2019;t a bit intimidated by the idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy is an extraordinary woman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your son is also extraordinary?&#x201d; <br><br>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. &#x201c;We like to think so, I suppose. He&#x2019;s quite self-reliant for a five-year-old.&#x201d; <br><br>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack&#x2019;s application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.<br><br>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We&#x2019;ll look at the hotel floor plans.&#x201d;<br><br>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plane of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman&#x2019;s cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel&#x2019;s kitchen, gearing down from lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Top floor,&#x201d; Ullman said briskly. &#x201c;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don&#x2019;t want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don&#x2019;t believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn&#x2019;t even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you wouldn&#x2019;t allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?<br><br>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.<br><br>&#x201c;The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,&#x201d; he said in a scholarly voice. &#x201c;Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views.&#x201d;<br><br>Could you at least spare the salestalk?<br><br>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.<br><br>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.<br>&#x201c;Forty rooms,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only about the basement,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;For the winter caretaker, that&#x2019;s the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall.&#x201d; He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook&#x2019;s operation as the boiler and the plumbing. &#x201c;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute...&#x201d;<br><br>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman&#x2019;s jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician&#x2019;s trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don&#x2019;t. This guy is a real heavyweight.<br><br>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker&#x2019;s suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply STAFF&nbsp; in small gold letters.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don&#x2019;t care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hun- dred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don&#x2019;t think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I&#x2019;m a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.<br><br>Ullman said: &#x201c;The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too proud of Harding and Nixon,&#x201d; Jack murmured.<br><br>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. &#x201c;It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the name,&#x201d; Jack said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold... except the Overlook. He funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a show- place. It was Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roque? &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his social secretary and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x201d; Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggily game behind the equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see that Ullman wasn&#x2019;t done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of it. <br><br>&#x201c;When he had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel people.<br><br>&#x201c;In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years, but I&#x2019;m happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook&#x2019;s accounts were written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack supposed that this fussy little man&#x2019;s pride was justified, and then his original dislike washed over him again in a wave.<br><br>He said: &#x201c;I see no connection between the Overlook&#x2019;s admittedly colorful history and your feeling that I&#x2019;m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order to cope with the problem, I&#x2019;ve installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can&#x2019;t get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a slow, hot grin&#x2014;the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin&#x2014;stretch across his mouth. &#x201c;Is that it? I&#x2019;m surprised Al didn&#x2019;t tell you. I&#x2019;ve retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He also told me about your last job... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don&#x2019;t believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady&#x2019;s case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your... uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970&#x2013;71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen&#x2019;s band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ullman said. &#x201c;The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the place really isn&#x2019;t cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#x201c;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours... under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn&#x2019;t hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below&#x2014;or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.<br><br>&#x201c;In the case of Grady,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?&#x201d; Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence&#x2014;murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He decided to press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he would stay cool.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he hurt them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He murdered the little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way. His leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he fell downstairs.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Burning Room (A Harry Bosch Novel, 17)</h2><p><b>In this #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, Detective Harry Bosch and his rookie partner investigate a cold case that gets very hot . . . very fast.</b><b><br></b>In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

I lacked confidence, and progress was slow. Then, out of the blue, I was made a gift of a story, &#x201c;a story just like a novel.&#x201d; What is more, the story was meant for me alone. It concerned a man whom I knew, or rather whom my family knew, in New York at one time. This was no ordinary man. Leaving Japan with nothing, he arrived in the United States and made a fortune there, literally realizing the American dream. His life had taken on the status of legend among Japanese communities in New York&#x2014;yet no one knew that he&#x2019;d had another life back in Japan, one marked by the poverty-stricken period that followed World War II. The tale of that life would almost certainly have disappeared, lost in the stream of time, if a young Japanese man who happened to hear it had not then crossed the Pacific and hand-delivered it to me in Palo Alto, like a precious offering. Of course, the preciousness of his offering was something the young man never knew. As far as he could tell, he merely traveled on his own initiative, sought me out of his own accord, then went away when he&#x2019;d told the story he wanted to tell. Yet I felt as if some invisible power had arranged to bring this messenger to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took all night to tell me the story. Outside, the heaviest rainstorm in California for decades raged, trapping us in the house. The angry power of nature must have affected my nerves: when he had finished, I was in shock. It felt uncanny that I should have known someone who had lived such a life&#x2014;and that, by a strange series of coincidences, his tale should have been delivered to me, and me alone.</p><h2>Black Wings of Cthulhu (Volume Two): Tales of Lovecraftian Horror</h2><p>Editor S.T.

Robert Burns: Selected Poems is edited by Kenneth Brown, Faculty of Education, University of Strathclyde.<b>Robert Burns</b> (1759-1796) was the son of a struggling tenant farmer in Ayrshire, who nevertheless joined with neighbours to employ a university-trained tutor for their children. When very young, Burns read the Bible, the English Augustans and Gray; later he immersed himself in the poetry of Milton and the sentimental fiction of Sterne.<br><br>The surrounding countryside was rich in folklore, but the vernacular poetry of Robert Fergusson came his way only by chance and it was not until his early twenties that he realized the possibilities of contemporary literature in Scots. Meanwhile the privation and overwork of subsistence farming began the rheumatic heart-disease that was to cause his premature death. His father died less than a month after averting bankruptcy proceedings in 1784 and Burns, as head of the family, leased a farm at Mossgeil. He began to circulate verse satires on Calvinist extremists, and in July 1786 the Church avenged itself by exacting public penance from him and Jean Armour who was pregnant by him and whom he acknowledged as his wife in 1788.<br><br><i>Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</i> was published in 1786 and enthusiastically received and Burns spent the winters of 1786-7 and 1787-8 in Edinburgh, acting out with increasing unease the role of child of nature and untutored poet of the plough in which the Edinburgh gentry had cast him, seeking relief in the city's hard-drinking low life. An admirer leased him a farm at Ellisland and in 1789 he was appointed to the Excise Division in nearby Dumfries. The farm failed, through lack of capital, and, continuing with the Excise, Burns devoted his main energies to the collection and rewriting of Scots songs. He moved to Dumfries in 1791, where, despite official investigation into his sympathies for the French Revolution, he was promoted in the Excise and helped to organize local Volunteer units. His health gave way and he died in 1796.</p><h2>The Real Mother Goose, Anniversary Edition</h2><p>For ninety years, The Real Mother Goose has been delighting millions of young children.

Those who shaped the political system became, very frequently, its victims. Those who were its victims were frequently quite blameless. &#34;The Whisperers&#34; recreates the sort of maze in which Russians found themselves, where an unwitting wrong turn could either destroy a family or, perversely, later save it: a society in which everyone spoke in whispers - whether to protect themselves, their families, neighbours or friends - or to inform on them.</p><p>Orlando Figes is Professor of History at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Hidden and hunted, the escape of southern slaves to the North remains a compelling event in American history. Within the pages of this book are documented, in prose and elegantly articulate photographs, examples of &#34;stations&#34; on the Railroad, along with images of the routes, lives, and hardships of both the &#34;passengers&#34; and &#34;conductors.&#34;</p><p>Raymond Bial is an acclaimed photoessayist for children. Four of his books were chosen as Notable Books in the Field of Social Studies by the NCSS. He lives in Urbana, Illinois, with his wife and children.<p>"Advantageously reproducing first-hand accounts and his own arresting photographs, Bial effectively evokes the era of slavery and its divisive effects on the United States." &#x2014;Publishers Weekly, Starred </p><p>"As Bial says in his introduction, photography was not yet invented when many of the daring escapes on the Underground Railroad occurred, and because everything had to be kept so secret, few documentary records have survived. In his simple photo-essay, he tries to re-create the experience of the brave runaways and conductors. He has photographed the places and objects that tell the story: the rivers the people crossed, the plantations they ran from, the homes that sheltered them with a lit window to signal a safe haven, the secret passages and trapdoors, and the courthouse yard where the slave auctions took place. He also includes drawings and prints from the times and a wanted poster for runaway "property." The text provides a brief historical overview, with quotes from some of the leaders, such as Tubman and Douglass. The book design is handsome, with thick paper, clear type, and fine reproductions; there's also a chronology and bibliography. Like a museum exhibit, the stirring photographs help us imagine what it must have been like for those who found the courage to run and to help others." &#x2014;April 1, 1995 Booklist, ALA </p><p>"Judicious use of first-person accounts and historical documents evokes the hardships that black people experienced under slavery and that eventually led them to seek out conductors who could guide them to freedom. Bial's well-composed, dramatically lit color photographs add life to the book, which is much more than a standard history. A map of the Railroad routes and an antislavery chronology are included." &#x2014;Horn Book</p></p><h2>The Darling Dahlias and the Confederate Rose</h2><p><b>National bestselling author Susan Wittig Albert returns to small-town Darling, Alabama, in the 1930s&#x2014;and the Darling Dahlias, the ladies of a garden club who aren&#x2019;t afraid to get their hands dirty solving mysteries...</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Just in time for the Confederate Day celebration, the Darling Dahlias are ready to plant Confederate roses along the town cemetery.

The late April sky was leaden gray and the young leaves on the live oak trees hung limp and unmoving in the languid Saturday afternoon air. Lizzy hadn&#x2019;t checked the thermometer beside the back door of the Darling Dahlias&#x2019; clubhouse, but she&#x2019;d bet dollars to doughnuts that the temperature was nudging ninety. And judging from the weight of the air and the way her blue blouse was sticking to her shoulders, the humidity was way up there, too. She glanced nervously toward the clouds in the west, which were tinged with a darker, more ominous purple. As she watched, a flash of lightning zigzagged from the base of the cloud.</p><p>Lizzy raised her voice to the women working in the large vegetable garden next to the clubhouse. All three of them&#x2014;Ophelia Snow, Verna Tidwell, and Bessie Bloodworth&#x2014;were club officers. Ophelia was the vice-president and secretary; Verna was treasurer; and Bessie was the newly elected club historian.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, everybody. Let&#x2019;s finish up as soon as we can. We don&#x2019;t want to be out here in the open when that storm hits.&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, Bessie put a hand to her back and straightened up, glancing toward the west. &#x201c;Gracious, Liz,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;That looks like a lollapalooza.&#x201d; She frowned down at the row she was hoeing. &#x201c;I guess these beans can wait. But we&#x2019;d better plan on putting in some sort of trellis. Kentucky Wonders are like Jack&#x2019;s beanstalk. They aim for the skies. If we wait much longer, we&#x2019;ll have a mess of snaky green vines all over the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Those are the seeds your cousin sent you from Birmingham?&#x201d; Lizzy asked. Good seeds weren&#x2019;t always easy to buy. The best often came from friends and family.</p><p>Bessie nodded. &#x201c;She saved them from her last year&#x2019;s garden. Says they&#x2019;re the best green beans she&#x2019;s ever grown.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we can come up with some cane poles and twine for a trellis,&#x201d; Lizzy said. She glanced back at the clouds. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s work on it later. I&#x2019;m not worried about getting wet&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t melt&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t like for us to be out in the garden when the lightning is flashing.&#x201d; She was remembering poor Mr. Burdette, who had been struck dead by lightning when he walked out to the pasture to bring the cows home for milking one afternoon. Spring storms could be violent.</p><p>Bessie gave the sky another apprehensive glance. &#x201c;And let&#x2019;s hope for no hail,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d sure hate to see all our little plants beaten to death.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just put in two more rows of okra, Liz,&#x201d; Verna called, coming along the path. She turned and pointed toward the far side of the garden, where an unpainted board fence and a row of crepe myrtles marked the edge of the clubhouse property. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s room for three more rows. By the time we get done planting, there&#x2019;ll be enough okra to feed everybody in Darling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Ophelia asked. &#x201c;Enough for everybody?&#x201d; Ophelia had a hoe in one hand and a rake in the other, and her round, sweet face was sweat-streaked and dirty.</p><p>&#x201c;There can never be enough okra,&#x201d; Bessie said emphatically.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; Ophelia said. To Lizzy, she added, &#x201c;The last of the English peas will need to be picked in the next few days, Liz. They&#x2019;ve stopped blooming, so that will be our final picking. And there are more carrots and beets to pull.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;I hope everybody comes to help, the way they did last time. It&#x2019;s a lot more fun when we have a good turnout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Many hands make light work,&#x201d; Bessie observed sensibly, and Lizzy smiled. She imagined Bessie&#x2019;s brain as a massive library of adages that were filed under various headings, at least one for every occasion. Of course, as the unofficial historian for the town of Darling, Bessie had many other things filed away in her mind, such as important events in the past, historically important sites, and family trees.</p><p>Verna sniffed. &#x201c;It would be nice if we would all show up,&#x201d; she remarked, with an edge to her voice.</p><p>Lizzy knew what Verna was thinking. The Dahlias had hosted a work party two weeks before, and thirteen out of the fourteen club members had attended. (Mrs. George E. Pickett Johnson was the missing person. She had offered to send her colored maid, Flossie, but Lizzy had declined. She knew Flossie and liked her, but she thought that Mrs. Johnson should come herself, not send her paid help.) Some of the Dahlias had picked and shelled peas, some had harvested lettuce and the last of the spring spinach, and some had pulled carrots, beets, and green onions. There was plenty for the Dahlias to share, as well as a big batch of fresh produce for the Saturday-morning farmers market, where they had a table. What they didn&#x2019;t sell, they gave away when the market closed. Lizzie had noticed that some of the poorer folks hung around until closing time and were glad to get whatever they could.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to organize another garden party, I guess,&#x201d; Lizzy said. Organizing came easily to her&#x2014;the reason, she supposed, that she&#x2019;d just been elected for another term as club president. &#x201c;This time, maybe Mrs. Johnson will come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget that we also have to organize a planting party at the cemetery next week,&#x201d; Bessie cautioned. &#x201c;Miss Rogers will never forgive us if we don&#x2019;t get those Confederate roses into the ground before the Confederate Day ceremony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>,&#x201d; Verna and Ophelia said in unison, and they all laughed. Miss Rogers, the town librarian and a longtime Dahlia, always insisted on using the Latin names for plants. Two years before, she had taken cuttings from everyone&#x2019;s garden and propagated fourteen Confederate roses (not really roses, but hibiscus).- The young shrubs were now large and sturdy enough to be planted along the front fence at the Darling Cemetery. And since Confederate Day (an important Darling holiday, as it is across the South) was coming up shortly, it was time to get the plants settled in their new home. Summer would be along soon&#x2014;not a good time for transplanting.</p><p>Verna looked up at the sky and held out her hand, palm up. &#x201c;Was that a raindrop?&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy grabbed the rake from Ophelia. &#x201c;Come on, girls&#x2014;let&#x2019;s put the tools away and cool off with some iced tea. Maybe the storm will blow over before we&#x2019;re ready to head for home.&#x201d;</p><p>A few minutes later, the four Dahlias were sitting around the green-painted table in the clubhouse kitchen, a pitcher of mint-flavored tea and a plate of Dr. George Washington Carver&#x2019;s peanut cookies in front of them. The cookies had been baked by Roseanne, the cook at Magnolia Manor, Bessie Bloodworth&#x2019;s boardinghouse for &#x201c;genteel older ladies,&#x201d; next door to the Dahlias&#x2019; clubhouse.</p><p>&#x201c;That was good work this afternoon, ladies,&#x201d; Lizzy said, pouring the tea. She looked around the table, thinking how much she cherished these three friends. She enjoyed all the Dahlias&#x2014;like different varieties of roses, each one had her own particular beauty, while some had a few thorns. But the three sitting around the table with her this afternoon were very special.</p><p>&#x201c;That was <i>hard</i> work,&#x201d; Bessie said, pulling an embroidered hanky out of her sleeve and wiping her sweaty face with it. &#x201c;But as the saying goes, we can&#x2019;t plow a field by turning it over in our minds.&#x201d;</p><p>Gray-haired Bessie was twenty years older than the others, but she could work as long and as hard as any of the younger women in the club. She always said she&#x2019;d grown up with a hoe in her hand and okra and sunflower seeds in her pocket. Everybody valued her gardening experience, especially now that the Dahlias had decided to start raising vegetables in a big way.</p><p>Lizzy had been on the lookout for projects that would keep the club growing and working together, and the vegetable garden&#x2014;a natural, really&#x2014;had been her idea. The front yard of the clubhouse they had inherited from Dahlia Blackstone had once been filled with azaleas, roses, and hydrangeas, and behind the house had been almost an acre of beautiful flowers, sweeping down toward a clump of woods and a clear spring surrounded by bog iris, ferns, and pitcher plants. Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s garden had been so beautiful that it had been featured in newspapers as far away as New Orleans and Miami, and visitors from all over the state had come to Darling to see it.</p><p>But by the time the Dahlias took it over, the flowers and shrubs were disconsolate and abandoned and the garden looked as if it had completely given up hope. Determined to rescue it and restore its former beauty, the members had pulled on their gardening gloves and set to work. They repaired the trellises for the Confederate jasmine and mandevilla and cut back the exuberant cross vine and honeysuckle on the fence. They cleared the curving perennial borders so that the Shasta daisies, phlox, iris, asters, and larkspur could stretch out and bloom. They divided and replanted the Easter lilies, spider lilies, oxblood lilies, and Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s favorite orange ditch lilies. They also pruned Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s many roses&#x2014;the climbers, teas, ramblers, shrubs, and the unruly yellow Lady Banks, who had spread her sweeping skirts of green branches across the back corner. (&#x201c;Give a Lady Banks an inch and she&#x2019;ll take a mile,&#x201d; Earlynn Biddle always said.)</p><p>But when all that was done, Lizzy didn&#x2019;t let the ladies rest on their laurels. Next door to the clubhouse, on the corner, was a large vacant lot that had once been Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s vegetable garden&#x2014;the perfect place to grow vegetables. They had hired old Mr. Norris and his bay gelding, Racer, to plow the ground. Racer&#x2019;s name was sort of a joke, because he was as slow as molasses on a cold January morning. But once the old horse made up his mind to get to work, he was all business, and Mr. Norris pocketed a few dollars every spring by plowing and harrowing the town gardens.</p><p>After Racer had finished plowing and harrowing the ground, the Dahlias got started, raking the soil smooth and marking the rows for the corn, green beans, collards, Swiss chard, okra, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, squash, melons, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes they intended to plant. Lizzy had pointed out that the money they earned from the sale of their vegetables could go to fund other projects, such as the herb garden they were planning at the Retirement Haven, the old folks&#x2019; home out on Rayburn Road, and the new landscaping they hoped to put in around the courthouse.</p><p>With that incentive, all the Dahlias were eager to pitch in and help. All, that is, except for Voleen Johnson, wife of the town&#x2019;s banker. Mrs. Johnson didn&#x2019;t like to get dirt under her manicured fingernails. She did agree, however, to take money at the Saturday market, although she wore her fanciest hat and a pair of dainty white gloves to keep the dirty coins and bills from soiling her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Hard work and <i>hot</i> work,&#x201d; Ophelia put in cheerfully. &#x201c;Wonder if it&#x2019;s going to be like this all summer. I swear, it must have been ten degrees above normal all this week.&#x201d; She got up from the table and turned on the small electric fan, aiming the cooling breeze at the group at the table. &#x201c;If it gets any hotter, I&#x2019;m going to have to sit down at the Singer and run up a couple of cotton sundresses for Sarah. Mrs. Snow gave me some material for them.&#x201d; She gave her head a rueful shake. &#x201c;That girl is growing faster&#x2019;n a weed. Seems like I&#x2019;m always letting her hems down another inch.&#x201d;</p><p>Ophelia was one of the younger Dahlias. She and Jed Snow (the mayor of Darling and the owner of Snow&#x2019;s Farm Supply) had two children, Sam, a boisterous fourteen, and Sarah, just eleven but taller than her mother. A dedicated mother and a talented seamstress, Ophelia made their clothes instead of buying them at Mann&#x2019;s Mercantile, which saved quite a lot. She was also raising chickens so she could sell eggs at the Saturday market. Of course, Mrs. Hancock, at Hancock&#x2019;s Groceries, would buy the eggs, but Ophelia could earn more by selling them herself. Lizzy knew that every penny counted for the Snows right now, because business at the Farm Supply was falling off, and what trade there was, was mostly on credit. The farmers didn&#x2019;t have much cash money for seed and fertilizer and none at all for new equipment, which meant that it was lean times for the Snows&#x2014;and for all the merchants who depended on the farmers&#x2019; trade.</p><p>Verna Tidwell tilted her glass and drank. &#x201c;Normal,&#x201d; she muttered darkly, pouncing on Ophelia&#x2019;s word. &#x201c;These days, I wonder what normal is. I&#x2019;m not sure <i>anybody</i> knows. And I&#x2019;m not talking about the temperature, either.&#x201d;</p><p>Unlike Ophelia, who had a reputation for smiling through even the most calamitous events, Verna had a much darker view of human nature. She had a habit of peering &#x201c;under the rocks,&#x201d; as she put it, on the lookout for anything suspicious. Her prickly skepticism put some people off&#x2014;but not Lizzy, who admired her friend&#x2019;s sharp eyes and even sharper mind. Verna ably employed her talents as manager of the Cypress County probate clerk and treasurer&#x2019;s office, in the county courthouse. That&#x2019;s where she heard the whispers about who was doing this or that or the other bad thing and what was going to happen when word of these misdeeds got to the wrong (or the right) person.</p><p>And since Verna never expected to find anybody behaving any better than anybody else, she was never disappointed or distressed when she discovered that so-and-so had lied about his property boundaries or siphoned twenty gallons of fuel oil out of the tank behind the county road maintenance building or was operating a whiskey still over on Shiner&#x2019;s Knob.</p><p>&#x201c;Comes with the territory,&#x201d; she always said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want to smell folks&#x2019; dirty laundry, you should stay out of the probate clerk&#x2019;s office. That&#x2019;s where it all hangs out.&#x201d;</p><p>But in the past couple of weeks, Lizzy had noticed that Verna&#x2019;s expression was darker than usual, and more frowning. She was unusually silent, too, and there were fewer barbed remarks. Something was troubling Verna, and Lizzy could guess what it was. In the law firm of Moseley and Moseley where she worked, she often picked up bits of courthouse gossip. She&#x2019;d heard that there was some sort of trouble&#x2014;serious trouble&#x2014;with the county treasurer&#x2019;s accounts. But while Verna usually shared her personal life with Lizzy, she was always closemouthed about things that went on at the office. So Lizzy didn&#x2019;t ask what was going on. If Verna felt the need to talk, she&#x2019;d do it&#x2014;in her own sweet time.</p><p>Now, as if to endorse Verna&#x2019;s dark view of <i>normal</i>, there was a flash of lightning and an almost instantaneous clap of thunder so loud that it rattled the windows in the old house. All four of the Dahlias jumped.</p><p>&#x201c;Sakes alive,&#x201d; Bessie exclaimed. &#x201c;That one was too close for comfort. Wonder if it struck somewhere here in town.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;One year, I remember, the Free Will Baptist Church was struck by lightning. Burned right down to the ground while the preacher and his flock were having a baptizing in the river. When they got back, there was nothing left but ashes.&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy chuckled.

Master horseback riders who lived in teepees and hunted bison, the Comanches were stunning orators, disciplined warriors, and the finest makers of arrows. They lived by a strict legal code and worshipped within a cosmology of magic. As he portrays the Comanche lifestyle, Fehrenbach re-creates their doomed battle against European encroachment. While they destroyed the Spanish dream of colonizing North America and blocked the French advance into the Southwest, the Comanches ultimately fell before the Texas Rangers and the U. S. Army in the great raids and battles of the mid-nineteenth century.

Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, and South Carolina are not bumps on the road of progress and harmony, but the results of a systemized, ubiquitous threat to &#x201c;black bodies&#x201d; in the form of slavery, police brutality, and mass incarceration.

Also included: poets who experienced the war as civilians, including Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and Conrad Aiken; poems by conscientious objectors and draft resisters, including William Stafford and Robert Lowell; and an elegy by James Tate for his father, who was killed in action when Tate was an infant.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p>Harvey Shapiro, editor, flew thirty-five missions as an Air Force radio gunner during World War II and was decorated for his service. He has edited both <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, and his many books of poetry include <i>National Cold Storage Company</i> (1988) and <i>How Charlie Shavers Died and Other Poems</i> (2001).*Starred Review* As Editor Shapiro points out, whereas several World War I poems were well known to those who served in World War II, the only well-known poem of the second war is Randall Jarrell's tiny chiller "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner." Perhaps that is because, Shapiro observes, the poems he presents are sharply different from the most famous World War I poems. The latter are by upper-class Englishmen who served as officers, and whose class solidarity shows in sweet patriotism and sweeter camaraderie, which endured after patriotism was soured by disillusionment. Shapiro's selections are by Americans who served as enlistees, older civilians jaundiced by the first war, and conscientious objectors. There is virtually no patriotism in them, and certainly no class feeling. They are the work of individuals wrenched out of normality and compelled to depend for their lives on others who in turn depend on them for theirs, but who don't feel compelled to like one another or to sacrifice themselves for their fellows. This state of consciousness is nowhere more forcefully expressed than in the harrowing long poem "World War II," about the crash of the bomber that Edward Field navigated into the North Sea. Many other fine poems come out of the war in the air, including Shapiro's own, though some of the sharpest, especially Louis Simpson's alarming rhymed quatrains and the excerpt from Peter Bowman's verse novel, <i>Beach Red</i> (1945), are infantrymen's work. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A good knowledge of linear algebra (including eigenvalues, bilinear forms, euclidean spaces, and tensor products of vector spaces) is presupposed, as well as some acquaintance with the methods of abstract algebra. The first four chapters might well be read by a bright undergraduate; however, the remaining three chapters are admittedly a little more demanding. Besides being useful in many parts of mathematics and physics, the theory of semisimple Lie algebras is inherently attractive, combining as it does a certain amount of depth and a satisfying degree of completeness in its basic results. Since Jacobson&#39;s book appeared a decade ago, improvements have been made even in the classical parts of the theory. I have tried to incor� porate some of them here and to provide easier access to the subject for non-specialists. For the specialist, the following features should be noted: (I) The Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of linear transformations is emphasized, with &#34;toral&#34; subalgebras replacing the more traditional Cartan subalgebras in the semisimple case. (2) The conjugacy theorem for Cartan subalgebras is proved (following D. J. Winter and G. D. Mostow) by elementary Lie algebra methods, avoiding the use of algebraic geometry.</p><p>J.E.

Thus, the literature on speciation, as well as the number of researchers and students working in this area, has grown explosively. Despite these developments, there has been no book-length treatment of speciation in many years. As a result, both the seasoned scholar and the newcomer to evolutionary biology had no ready guide to the recent literature on speciation--a body of work that is enormous, scattered, and increasingly technical. Although several excellent symposium volumes have recently appeared, these collections do not provide a unified, critical, and up-to-date overview of the field. <em>Speciation</em> is designed to fill this gap.<br><br>Aimed at professional biologists, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates, <em>Speciation</em> covers both plants and animals (the first book on this subject to do so), and deals with all relevant areas of research, including biogeography, field work, systematics, theory, and genetic and molecular studies. It gives special emphasis to topics that are either controversial or the subject of active research, including sympatric speciation, reinforcement, the role of hybridization in speciation, the search for genes causing reproductive isolation, and mounting evidence for the role of natural and sexual selection in the origin of species. The authors do not hesitate to take stands on these and other controversial issues. This critical and scholarly book will be invaluable to researchers in evolutionary biology and is also ideal for a graduate-level course on speciation.<br></p><p><br>The authors have collaborated since 1989, coauthoring a number of research and review papers on speciation.<br><br><strong>Jerry A.

His research interests include population genetics, the genetics of speciation in <em>Drosophila</em>, and the genetics of adaptation.<br><br>"Coyne and Orr have done the field a great favour by synthesising so much research so comprehensively. I think the book will serve its purpose of teaching upcoming (and existing) generations of evolutionary biologists of what we do and do not know about speciation. It will literally be the point of reference for the next ten years."--Menno Schilthuizen, <em>BioEssays</em><p></p><br>"Coyne and Orr's thorough and thoughtful review of speciation ranges over the entire field and examines it dispassionately. Theirs is a remarkable work of synthesis, and it belongs on every biologist's bookshelf. On the whole, this book is a wonderful resource and a fine example of what happens when clever scientists take a clear and unbiased look at the evidence. It will, I predict, join the pantheon of really important books about evolution."--Christopher Wills, <em>Journal of Heredity</em><p></p><br>"I highly recommend this deeply insightful book. The field of speciation research was in need of a sagacious update, and this benchmark work will provide a solid foundation for further scientific inquiry into what has been one of evolution's most engaging and enduring mysteries."--John C. Avise, <em>Perspectives in Biology and Medicine</em><p></p><br>"Coyne and Orr's <em>Speciation</em> has been eagerly awaited. If its messages are heeded, it will bring much-needed order and rigor to the current burst of activity. Systematic and incisive analysis is what makes the book so powerful. Coyne and Orr have done the field a great service by providing such a clear analysis of the status quo. Hopefully, a wide audience will read the book, apply similarly rigorous arguments and direct their research efforts more profitably as a result."--Roger K.

The resulting clinical trials and health services research studies require instruments to monitor the outcomes of care and the output of the health system. However, the over-abundance of competing measurement scales can make choosing a measure difficult at best. <em>Measuring Health</em> provides in-depth reviews of over 100 of the leading health measurement tools and serves as a guide for choosing among them.LNow in its third edition, this book provides a critical overview of the field of health measurement, with a technical introduction and discussion of the history and future directions for the field. This latest edition updates the information on each of the measures previously reviewed, and includes a complete new chapter on anxiety measurement to accompany the one on depression. It has also added new instruments to those previously reviewed in each of the chapters in the book.LChapters cover measurements of physical disability, social health, psychological well-being, anxiety, depression, mental status testing, pain, general health status and quality of life. Each chapter presents a tabular comparison of the quality of the instruments reviewed, followed by a detailed description of each method, covering its purpose and conceptual basis, its reliability and validity and, where possible, shows a copy of the actual scale. To ensure accuracy of the information, each review has been approved by the original author of each instrument or by an acknowledged expert.<br></p><p>Ian McDowell is at University of Ottawa.<br>"McDowell's learned input contributes substantially to the status of this text as a 'must have'...This is an extensively researched text with an exhaustive offering of measurement principles and approaches. Clinicians, researchers, and psychometrists will value the review of scales and the evaluative commentary offered by the clearly knowledgeable Ian McDowell."--<em>PsycCRITIQUES</em><p></p><br>"Ian McDowell has crafted a real masterpiece with this, the 3rd edition of his magisterial overview of the science--and to put it mildly, it knocks the socks of almost all the (admittedly limited) competition...The description of concepts and the presentation of pertinent material provide the reader with a well-balanced portfolio of essential intelligence...should be required reading for all newcomers to the subject and might well repay the occasional visit from older hands too."--<em>Public Health</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Arab Historians of the Crusades (Islamic World series)</h2><p>The recapture of Jerusalem, the siege of the Acre, the fall of Tripoli, the effect in Baghdad of events in Syria; these and other happening were faithfully recorded by Arab historians during the two centuries of the Crusades. For the first time contemporary accounts of the fighting between Muslim and Christian have been translated into English, and the Western reader can learn 'the other side' of the Holy War.<br><br>Seventeen authors are represented in the extracts in this work, which have been drawn from various types of historical writings. The excerpts are taken firstly from the general histories of the Muslim world, then from chronicles of cities, regions and their dynasties, and finally from biographies or records of the deeds of certain persons. The Arab histories of the Crusades compare favorably with their Christian counterparts in their rich accumulation of material and chronological information. Another of their merits is their faithful characterization, which they practiced in the brief but illuminating sketches of enemy leaders: Baldwin II's shrewdness, Richard Coeur de Lion's prowess in war, the indomitable energy of Conrad of Motferrat, Frederick II's diplomacy. The chronicles are generous, naturally, with their praises of the great champions of the Muslim resistance, especially of Saladin, who towers above all the other leaders in heroic stature. Although, this book gives a sweeping and stimulating view of the Crusades seen through Arab eyes.</p><p>Text: English, Italian, Arabic (translation)<strong>'Professor Gabrieli has been completely successful in presenting a precise, vivid and impartial picture of these two centuries of relations between the Arabic-speaking world of the Middle East and the Christian world of Europe' </strong><em>- Asian Affairs</em></p><h2>Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond (Music in the Twentieth Century, Series Number 9)</h2><p>Michael Nyman&#39;s book is a first-hand account of experimental music from 1950 to 1970. First published in 1974, it has remained the classic text on a significant form of music making and composing that developed alongside, and partly in opposition to, the postwar modernist tradition of composers such as Boulez, Berio, or Stockhausen. The experimentalist par excellence was John Cage whose legendary 4&#39; 33&#39;&#39; consists of four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence to be performed on any instrument. Such pieces have a conceptual rather than purely musical starting point and radically challenge conventional notions of the musical work. Nyman&#39;s book traces the revolutionary attitudes that were developed toward concepts of time, space, sound, and composer/performer responsibility. It was within the experimental tradition that the seeds of musical minimalism were sown and the book contains reference to the early works of Reich, Riley, Young, and Glass. This second edition contains a new Foreword, an updated discography, and a historical overview by the author.</p><p>This book, by the composer Michael Nyman, is a first-hand account of the postwar experimental tradition in music.

Abraham and Torok advocate a form of psychoanalysis that insists on the particularity of any individual's life story, the specificity of texts, and the singularity of historical situations. In what is both a critique and an extension of Freud, they develop interpretive strategies with powerful implications for clinicians, literary theorists, feminists, philosophers, and all others interested in the uses and limits of psychoanalysis.<br> <br> Central to their approach is a general theory of psychic concealment, a poetics of hiding. Whether in a clinical setting or a literary text, they search out the unspeakable secret as a symptom of devastating trauma revealed only in linguistic or behavioral encodings. Their view of trauma provides the linchpin for new psychic and linguistic structures such as the "transgenerational phantom," an undisclosed family secret handed down to an unwitting descendant, and the intra-psychic secret or "crypt," which entombs an unspeakable but consummated desire. Throughout, Abraham and Torok seek to restore communication with those intimate recesses of the mind which are, for one reason or another, denied expression.<br> <br> Classics of French theory and practice, the essays in volume one include four previously uncollected works by Maria Torok. Nicholas Rand supplies a substantial introductory essay and commentary throughout. Abraham and Torok's theories of fractured meaning and their search for coherence in the face of discontinuity and disruption have the potential to reshape not only psychoanalysis but all disciplines concerned with issues of textual, oral, or visual interpretation.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Economics of Health and Health Care: International Student Edition, 8th Edition</h2><p><p>Folland, Goodman, and Stano&#x2019;s bestselling <i>The Economics of Health and Health Care </i>text offers the market-leading overview of all aspects of Health Economics, teaching<i> </i>through core economic themes, rather than concepts unique to the health care<i> </i>economy.</p> <p></p> <p>The Eighth Edition of this key textbook has been revised and updated throughout, and reflects changes since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

What does this cost? What happens when something goes wrong?</p> <p>Logistics and Supply Chain Management (SCM) are the areas of study which help us to explore and answer these questions. Today they play a very important role in underpinning the success of many organisations across the public and private sectors and impact how we live our lives. While the origins of logistics and SCM are firmly embedded in the manufacturing domain, the successful applications of logistics and SCM principles and practices are becoming increasingly relevant in the services area also &#x2013; see for example, the many changes that have recently been driven into healthcare systems and airlines.</p> <p><b><i>Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management</i></b>, now in its third edition, provides essential reading for anybody studying SCM and logistics. Encompassing both practical and strategic perspectives, it takes a truly global perspective, recognising the transnational nature of logistics activities in today&#x2019;s world.</p> <p>Key features of this new and extended third edition include:</p> <ul> <li>18 up-to-date chapters on all aspects of logistics and SCM, including coverage of emerging and important topics such as security, technology and automation in logistics, supply chain data flows, logistics and the internet of everything, sustainability, supply chain vulnerability and trade facilitation.</li> <li>New chapters include one on management science applications, which provides an easy and clear introduction to key quantitative techniques that can be applied to logistics and SCM.</li> <li>12 updated case studies, including new case studies on air cargo, port&#x2013;city logistics, automobile manufacturing logistics and logistics infrastructure appraisal.</li> </ul> <p>A comprehensive package of supplementary material is available on the accompanying website at <b>www.wiley.com/college/mangan</b>, including an Instructor&#x2019;s Manual, PowerPoint slides and case teaching notes for lecturers, as well as quizzes and an online glossary for students.</p></p><p><p><b>John Mangan</b> is Professor of Marine Transport and Logistics at Newcastle University, UK and <b>Chandra Lalwani </b>is Adjunct Professor at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>&#x201c;This 3rd edition of <i>Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management</i> covers comprehensively all traditional and emergent aspects of the field.

The book's focus on three central and profoundly interconnected stories--the unfolding of the Cold War, the growth of the international economy, and the developing world's quest for political and economic independence--offers students a framework for understanding the past and making sense of the present. Attentive to overarching themes, individual historical figures, and diverse nations--and now substantially revised with a new Part 4 that examines world events since 1990--<em>The World Transformed</em>, Second Edition, is ideal for courses on post-1945 world history, international relations, or global topics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael H.

Having added chapters that cover the post-Cold War decades, Hunt provides a remarkably informed, balanced, and nuanced exploration of an era of unprecedented globalization. His capacious narrative is attentive to both the upside and perils of ever accelerating transnational and cross-cultural connections and is replete with vignettes that underscore human agency. <em>The World Transformed</em> is the most compelling and thought-provoking assessment available on the tumultuous quarter-century from the end of World War II through the present day."--Michael Adas, <em>Rutgers University</em> <br><p></p><br>"The second edition of Michael Hunt's <em>The World Transformed</em> is the most comprehensive and up-to-date historical survey of the post-1945 period. While the overall structure and approach remain broadly similar to the first edition, new chapters, revisions, and features add substantially to the book's interpretive power. Of particular importance are the additions of two new chapters on the post-1990 period, which offer detailed coverage of the last quarter-century. In addition, thoroughly revised recommended resources at the end of each chapter will allow students to pursue the most recent research on a wide variety of subjects. It is a terrific narrative and analysis for any course focusing on the post-1945 period."--Heather Streets-Salter, <em>Northeastern University</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Destroying Sanctuary: The Crisis in Human Service Delivery Systems</h2><p>For the last thirty years, the nation's mental health and social service systems have been under relentless assault, with dramatically rising costs and the fragmentation of service delivery rendering them incapable of ensuring the safety, security, and recovery of their clients. The resulting organizational trauma both mirrors and magnifies the trauma-related problems their clients seek relief from. Just as the lives of people exposed to chronic trauma and abuse become organized around the traumatic experience, so too have our social service systems become organized around the recurrent stress of trying to do more under greater pressure: they become crisis-oriented, authoritarian, disempowered, and demoralized, often living in the present moment, haunted by the past, and unable to plan for the future.<br><br>Complex interactions among traumatized clients, stressed staff, pressured organizations, and a social and economic climate that is often hostile to recovery efforts recreate the very experiences that have proven so toxic to clients in the first place. Healing is possible for these clients if they enter helping, protective environments, yet toxic stress has destroyed the sanctuary that our systems are designed to provide.<br><br>This thoughtful, impassioned critique of business as usual begins to outline a vision for transforming our mental health and social service systems. Linking trauma theory to organizational function, Destroying Sanctuary provides a framework for creating truly trauma-informed services. The organizational change method that has become known as the Sanctuary Model lays the groundwork for establishing safe havens for individual and organizational recovery. The goals are practical: improve clinical outcomes, increase staff satisfaction and health, increase leadership competence, and develop a technology for creating and sustaining healthier systems. Only in this way can our mental health and social service systems become empowered to make a more effective contribution to the overall health of the nation.<br><br>Destroying Sanctuary is a stirring call for reform and recovery, required reading for anyone concerned with removing the formidable barriers to mental health and social services, from clinicians and administrators to consumer advocates.<br></p><p><br>Sandra L.

In this accessible and illuminating book he deals with the classical opposition of magic with science and religion. He reviews the great debates in classical Judaism, early Greek science, Renaissance philosophy, the Protestant Reformation, and the scientific revolution, and then reconsiders the three major interpretive approaches to magic in anthropology: the intellectualist and evolutionary theories of Tylor and Frazer, Malinowski&#39;s functionalism, and L�vy-Bruhl&#39;s philosophical anthropology, which posited a distinction between mystical and logical mentalities. He follows with a wide-ranging and suggestive discussion of rationality and relativism and concludes with a discussion of new thinking in the history and philosophy of science, suggesting fresh perspectives on the classical opposition between science and magic.</p><p>Three major interpretative approaches to magic in anthropology follow a review of the great debates in classical Judaism, early Greek science, Renaissance philosophy, the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.Most anthropologists who have attempted to demarcate and contrast magic, science and religion as cross-cultural categories appear to have been unaware of the rich and long intellectual history of Western thought which framed their own specialized writings. In this book, Professor Tambiah reexamines magic, science and religion within the framework of this history, including the Judaic religion, early Greek science, Renaissance philosophy, the Protestant Reformation, and the European scientific revolution in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p><h2>Loose-Leaf Version for Psychology in Modules</h2><p>New unused with no markings</p><p></p><h2>Teaching Children With Autism to Mind-Read : A Practical Guide for Teachers and Parents</h2><p>The difficulties experienced by children with autism and related conditions in inferring the thoughts, beliefs, desires and intentions of others are well documented in numerous studies.

Yet often these groups have little input to archaeological research, and its results remain inaccessible. As archaeologists consider the consequences and benefits of research, the skills, methodologies, and practices required of them will differ dramatically from those of past decades. <br><br>As an archaeologist and a Native American, Sonya Atalay has investigated the rewards and complex challenges of conducting research in partnership with indigenous and local communities. In Community-Based Archaeology, she outlines the principles of community-based participatory research and demonstrates how CBPR can be effectively applied to archaeology. Drawing on her own experiences with research projects in North America and the Near East, Atalay provides theoretical discussions along with practical examples of establishing and developing collaborative relationships and sharing results. This book will contribute to building an archaeology that is engaged, ethical, relevant, and sustainable.</p><p>&#x201c;Community Based Participatory Research in archaeology finally comes of age with Atalay&#x2019;s long-anticipated volume. She promotes a collaborative approach to knowledge gathering, interpretation, and use that benefits descendant communities and archaeological practitioners, contributing to a more relevant, rewarding, and responsible archaeology. This is essential reading for anyone who asks why we do archaeology, for whom, and how best can it be done.&#x201d; &#x2013; George Nicholas, author of <i>Being and Becoming Indigenous Archaeologists</i><br><br>&#x201c;Sonya Atalay shows archaeologists how the process of Community Based Participatory Research can move our efforts at collaboration with local communities beyond theory and good intentions to a sustainable practice.

It is unusual in offering a well-balanced introduction, stressing equally theory and practice. It avoids the formidable mathematical structure of fluid dynamics, while conveying by often unorthodox methods a full understanding of the physical phenomena and mathematical concepts of aeronautical engineering. <i>Theory of Flight</i> contains perhaps the best introduction to the general theory of stability, while the introduction to dynamics of incompressible fluids and the chapters on wing theory remain particularly valuable for their clarity of exposition and originality of thought.<br>Mises' position as one of the great pioneers in the development of the aeronautical sciences lends a flavor of authenticity not found in more conventional textbooks. Any student who has made himself familiar with his exposition of the fundamentals and applications will have acquired an excellent background for additional, more specialized fields of modern aeronautical engineering.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Electromagnetic Fields, 2nd Edition</h2><p>This revised edition provides patient guidance in its clear and organized presentation of problems.

Alfred emerges from the pages of this biography as a great warlord, an effective and inventive ruler, and a passionate scholar whose piety and intellectual curiosity led him to sponsor a cultural and spiritual renaissance. Alfred's victories on the battlefield and his sweeping administrative innovations not only preserved his native Wessex from viking conquest, but began the process of political consolidation that would culminate in the creation of the kingdom of England. <br><br><i>Alfred the Great: War, Kingship and Culture in Anglo-Saxon England</i> strips away the varnish of later interpretations to recover the historical Alfredpragmatic, generous, brutal, pious, scholarly within the context of his own age.<br></p><p><p>FRONT OF COVER: Final: 2.4.98<br>ALFRED THE GREAT<br> <br>War, Kingship and Culture in Anglo-Saxon England<br>RICHARD ABELS<br>THE MEDIEVAL WORLD<br>SPINE:<br> <br>ALFRED THE GREAT<br> <br>ABELS<br> <br>[colophon]<br>OUTSIDE TRIM:<br>Probable price:<br> <br>Probable publication:<br>BACK OF COVER:<br> <br>THE MEDIEVAL WORLD<br>General Editor: David Bates<br>Professor of Medieval History, University of Glasgow<br> <br>The influence of Alfred - king of Wessex from 871 to 899 - pervades English history. His victories on the battlefield and his administrative innovations not only preserved his native Wessex from viking conquest, but also began the process of political consolidation and unification that would culminate, within a couple of generations, in the creation of the kingdom of England. <br> <br>Alfred was a great warrior king, and an effective and inventive ruler. But, even more remarkably, he was also a lover of wisdom, who sought to preserve and disseminate Latin learning by translating into English the books most necessary for all men to know . The spiritual and literary renaissance he spearheaded gave rise to a lasting tradition of English vernacular prose and learning. <br> <br>He himself claimed that what he most desired was to live a worthy life, and to leave to posterity his memory in good works. This is precisely what he accomplished. Few bearers of the sobriquet the Great have so firm a hold on the title: eleven hundred years after his death, his name still resonates, and modern scholarship has not undermined his reputation. Yet that status carries its own dangers: he seems such a modern figure that each generation is tempted to recreate him in its own image. One of the great virtues of Richard Abels s splendid new study of the king, however, is to strip away the varnish of such later interpretations, in order to recover the historical figure - pragmatic, generous, brutal, pious, scholarly - within the context of Alfred s own age.<br> <br>The book is timely, fresh and authoritative. It is based throughout on the primary sources, but it also presents a judicious assessment of recent scholarship in interpreting the man and his times. It has been written with a student and non-specialist readership in mind, but fellow specialists will find much in it to stimulate and challenge (and many will especially welcome the re-assertion of Asser s life of Alfred as a key contemporary source for the reign, against recent scholarly attack).<br> <br>Richard Abels s Alfred convinces as a man who combined within himself the complexities and contradictions of his time. But, fascinating though that portrait is, this is more than just a study of an individual, however Great : the book investigates, and illuminates, the whole nature of warfare, culture and kingship in Anglo-Saxon England.<br> <br>RICHARD ABELS is Professor of History at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis.<br> </p><p>RICHARD ABELS is Professor of History at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis.</p></p><h2>Charlemagne: Father of a Continent</h2><p>The most important study of Charlemagne in a generation, this biography by distinguished medievalist Alessandro Barbero illuminates both the man and the world in which he lived. Charles the Great&#x2015;Charlemagne&#x2015;reigned from a.d. 768 to a.d. 814. At the time if his death, his empire stretched across Europe to include Bavaria, Saxony, parts of Spain, and Italy. With a remarkable grasp of detail and a sweeping knowledge of Carolingian institutions and economy, Barbero not only brings Charlemagne to life with accounts of his physical appearance, tastes and habits, family life, and ideas and actions but also conveys what it meant to be king of the Franks and, later, emperor. He recounts how Charlemagne ruled his empire, kept justice, and waged wars. He vividly describes the nature of everyday life at that time, how the economy functioned, and how Christians perceived their religion. Barbero's absorbing analysis of how concepts of slavery and freedom were subtly altered as feudal relations began to grow underscores the dramatic changes that the emperor's wars brought to the political landscape. Engaging and informed by deep scholarship, this latest account provides a new and richer context for considering one of history's most fascinating personalities.</p><p>"Barbero's lively and entertaining study provides a superb overview of the latest scholarship on the Carolingian age and constructs a compelling argument for Charlemagne's pivotal role as the father of Europe. We gain a sense of the look and feel of peasant villages, the dynamic interplay of monastic economies and long-distance trade, and the manipulation of justice by local notables. This is <i>histoire totale </i>at its best."&#x2015;Sharon Farmer, author of <i>Surviving Poverty in Medieval Paris </i><br><br>"This up-to-date account focuses on the man and his times while clearly and judiciously dealing with key historio-graphical issues. Barbero explores and explodes the myths that have grown up around the emperor."&#x2015;Barbara H. Rosenwein, Loyola University<b>Alessandro Barbero</b> is Professor of Medieval History at the University of Piemonte Orientale, Italy. In addition to writing about medieval society and culture, he is the author of the historical novel <i>Bella vita e guerre altrui di Mr. Pyle, gentiluomo,</i> which won the Strega Prize in 1996. Over a period of twelve years, <b>Allan Cameron </b>has translated some twenty books on history, philosophy, and other academic disciplines, including works by leading Italian philosopher Norberto Bobbio and President of the European Commission Romano Prodi.</p><h2>Religion and Science</h2><p>In this timely work, Russell, philosopher, agnostic, mathematician, and renowned peace advocate, offers a brief yet insightful study of the conflicts between science and traditional religion during the last four centuries. Examining accounts in which scientific advances clashed with Christian doctrine or biblical interpretations of the day, from Galileo and the Copernican Revolution, to the medical breakthroughs of anesthesia and inoculation, Russell points to the constant upheaval and reevaluation of our systems of belief throughout history. In turn, he identifies where similar debates between modern science and the Church still exist today. Michael Ruse's new introduction brings these conflicts between science and theology up to date, focusing on issues arising after World War II.<br> This classic is sure to interest all readers of philosophy and religion, as well as those interested in Russell's thought and writings.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Bertrand Russell</strong>, English philosopher and mathematician, was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he taught for many years. He also lectured widely in the United States. Winner of the 1950 Nobel Prize for Literature, he is the author of many books including the influential <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, with Alfred North Whitehead, and <em>The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872-1967</em>, published in three volumes. <br> <strong>Michael Ruse</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and Zoology at the University of Guelph, Ontario. He is the author of many books, including <em>Evolutionary Naturalism</em> and <em>The Darwinian Paradigm</em>.<br>[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE, RELATIVITY, and MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH.]--The Listen to a Genius series is a collection of CD reissues of recordings made by Audio Scholar in the 1990s. The idea--to present a cross section of writings by the world's greatest thinkers--is admirable. But while the production quality and narration are generally excellent, the series has some problems. First, the complete absence of liner notes is a disappointment. More importantly, the abridgments of these great works are often so drastic that they fail to provide a coherent introduction to the author's work. In his preface to RELATIVITY, for example, Einstein writes that his book requires "a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader." Indeed, a work of this complexity would have a reader continually rereading, something that is impractical in the audio medium. As a result, this recording will likely appeal only to those with a solid background in physics or mathematics, despite Einstein's remarkably lucid prose and the unflinching Julian Lopez-Morillas, who delivers it with clarity. Similar flaws bog down THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE, also read by Lopez-Morillas. Though Stephen Hawking gets top billing, he is the author of only one of the four selections in this recording. His contribution, like his famous book A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME (millions sold, perhaps hundreds read and understood), has fascinating and memorable passages but is altogether impenetrable to the non-physicist. The high point of the recording, rather, is Paul Thagard's "Conceptual Revolutions," an erudite but accessible look at the major leaps in scientific thought. Bertrand Russell's RELIGION AND SCIENCE is much easier to digest. Published in 1935, it looks at the conflicts between these two integral parts of human culture. The writing is clear, and the abridgment, while it retains only a fraction of the original work, is tidy if not seamless. David Case sounds pedantic at first, but once listeners warm to him, they'll be happy to have exchanged Einstein's quantum physics for this introduction to Russell's metaphysics. Mohandas Gandhi's MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH (1925) is an altogether different kind of philosophy. Frederick Davidson has chosen to read this autobiography of India's great spiritual leader with an affected accent, an odd choice in a work of nonfiction. But it works: It helps to ground a rambling piece of writing, helping this title to come closest to fulfilling the aim of the Listen to a Genius series.

But music could not be explained without addressing language, and could not be accounted for without understanding the evolution of the human body and mind. Thus Mithen arrived at the wildly ambitious project that unfolds in this book: an exploration of music as a fundamental aspect of the human condition, encoded into the human genome during the evolutionary history of our species.</p><p>Music is the language of emotion, common wisdom tells us. In <i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>, Mithen introduces us to the science that might support such popular notions. With equal parts scientific rigor and charm, he marshals current evidence about social organization, tool and weapon technologies, hunting and scavenging strategies, habits and brain capacity of all our hominid ancestors, from <i>australopithecines</i> to <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> and Neanderthals to <i>Homo sapiens</i>--and comes up with a scenario for a shared musical and linguistic heritage. Along the way he weaves a tapestry of cognitive and expressive worlds--alive with vocalized sound, communal mimicry, sexual display, and rhythmic movement--of various species. </p><p>The result is a fascinating work--and a succinct riposte to those, like Steven Pinker, who have dismissed music as a functionless evolutionary byproduct.</p></p><p>Steven Mithen is Professor of Early Prehistory and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the University of Reading.Why should music be so important to us? Steven Mithen begins his task with a detailed analysis of music and musical ability, drawing on musicology, psychology and neurobiology to build a comprehensive and erudite picture of music's capacity to move us...This is a long-overdue book, which approaches human evolution from an intriguing as well as entertaining angle. (R. I. M. Dunbar <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2005-07-28)<br><br>Mithen draws on archaeological record and current research on neurology and genetics to explain how and why humans think, talk and make music the way they do. If it sounds impenetrably academic, it isn't: Mithen acts as a friendly guide to the troves of data on the evolution of man (and myriad sub-mysteries of the mind, music, speech and cognition), translating specialist material into an engrossing narrative casual readers will appreciate...Mithen's expertise in the science and history of his subject is combined with a passion for music that makes this book enjoyable and fascinating. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-02-27)<br><br>Mithen has many fascinating suggestions about how the circumstances of early hominid life on the African savanna may have provoked changes in anatomy and improved the range and precision of communication...By bringing music to the fore, Mithen remedies earlier neglect and offers his readers the most perspicacious portrait of the role of communication among our remote predecessors that I have ever encountered. That is a great accomplishment...Mithen's book, in short, seems destined to become a landmark in the way experts and amateurs alike seek to understand the character and evolutionary importance of hominid and early human communication...[<i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>] offers a learned, imaginative overview of the most important and most elusive dimension of the real but unrecorded past: i.e., how communication among our predecessors changed their lives, sustained their communities, and promoted their survival. No one has previously undertaken that task so well. (William H. McNeill <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2006-04-27)<br><br>With a fascinating blend of neurology, anatomy, archaeology, developmental psychology and musicology, Mithen seeks the source of our propensity for making music, a universal human feature that has been strangely neglected compared with the origin of language. (Blake Edgar <i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>Among the most dicey academic inquiries are the ones that deal with the origin of human consciousness. Faced with difficulties of such daunting scope, Steven Mithen remains undaunted. In his 1996 book, <i>The Prehistory of the Mind</i>, he argued that both the origins of thought and the origins of human language are natural outcomes of evolution. But according to the first chapter of Mithen's latest work, <i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>, that story was incomplete. What it neglected was the central role of music in the psychosocial makeup of our species...'Without music,' Mithen writes, 'the prehistoric past is just too quiet to be believed'...Thus, Mithen speculates, humanity might have developed much as the individual does: music first, then language. From an evolutionary standpoint, music would not only help ensure the well-being of the individual, but also the cohesiveness of the group. Calling on primate studies, Mithen likens group music-making to grooming, an activity that evokes feelings of contentment and belonging...Taken as a look at the natural history of music, Mithen's book is thoughtful and certainly entertaining.

Marschall <i>Natural History</i> 2006-10-01)<br><br><i>The Singing Neanderthals: The Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body</i> by Steven Mithen is a book that has you making up your own theories about how grunts became speech and songs.

It was the first biology textbook ever reviewed by <i>Time</i> and was also featured with illustrations in <i>Life</i>. Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago, and more than eighty other colleges and universities adopted it for use in courses. Since then, its clear explanations and ample illustrations have continued to introduce hundreds of thousands of students and general readers around the world to jellyfishes, corals, flatworms, squids, starfishes, spiders, grasshoppers, and the other invertebrates that make up ninety-seven percent of the animal kingdom.<br> <br> This new edition has been completely rewritten and redesigned, but it retains the same clarity and careful scholarship that have earned this book its continuing readership for half a century. It is even more lavishly illustrated than earlier editions, incorporating many new drawings and photographs. Informative, concise legends that form an integral part of the text accompany the illustrations. The text has been updated to include findings from recent research. Eschewing pure morphology, the authors use each group of animals to introduce one or more biological principles.<br> <br> In recent decades, courses and texts on invertebrate zoology at many universities have been available only for advanced biology majors specializing in this area. The Third Edition of <i>Animals Without Backbones</i> remains an ideal introduction to invertebrates for lower-level biology majors, nonmajors, students in paleontology and other related fields, junior college and advanced high school students, and the general reader who pursues the rewarding study of the natural world.</p></p><p><b>Ralph Buchsbaum </b>was professor emeritus of biology at the University of Pittsburgh. <b>Mildred Buchsbaum</b> has collaborated on previous editions of <i>Animals Without Backbones</i>. <b>John Pearse</b>, a professor of biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and <b>Vicki Pearse</b>, a research associate in biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are coeditors with A.

I struggled to, anyway: the decades-old dog-eared copy that I found at the back of my dad's bookcase had a loose monochrome cover that always wanted to come off in my hands. This was a link to his world as a scientist, and to what he did all day. (Actually, he was a research chemist, but what did I know.) More, the book was a glimpse of a world just as alien as those in the pages of my <i>2000 AD</i> comic, peopled with warlocks and genetic infantrymen. The pictures looked hand-drawn, and showed features on the outside of the creatures as well as their inner structures. I studied those pages and copied the drawings&#x2014;the stunning representation of the <i>Hydra</i> especially&#x2014;into my sketch pad, next to Rogue Trooper and Judge Dredd. <i>2000 AD</i> later published one of those drawings, but it was the fantastic stories of the true, hidden world of invertebrates that really fired my imagination.&#x201d; (David Adam <i>Nature</i>)</p><h2>Multiple Regression in Practice (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)</h2><p>Berry and Feldman provide a systematic treatment of many of the major problems encountered in using regression analysis. Since it is likely that one or more of the assumptions of the regression model will be violated in a specific empirical analysis, the ability to know when problems exist and when to take appropriate action helps to ensure the proper use of the procedure.The authors discuss: the consequences of violating the assumptions of the regression model; procedures for detecting when such violations occur; and strategies for dealing with these problems when they arise.The monograph was written without the use of matrix algebra, in order to make it more accessible.

Major research and teaching interests include public policy, budgeting, state politics and research methodology. Berry&#x2019;s primary areas of interest are public policy, American state politics, and research methodology. Throughout his career, his work has focused on explaining why governments make the policy choices they do, and improving the methodologies available for studying policy making. Among his current research projects are analyses of the impact of electoral competition on the policy choices made by state legislators, and the effect of state welfare policy on poverty in the United States. Berry&#x2019;s current research on methodology focuses on the development of techniques for estimating econometric models with binary dependent variables, and methods for studying policy diffusion using geographical information systems. Berry has also been working for several years collecting data on outcomes of all state legislative elections in the U.S. since the 1960s; he has begun to use these data to study the behavior of challengers in state legislative elections, and the role of partisan and incumbent protection goals in determining the nature of redistricting in state legislatures.<br><br>Areas of Interest:<br>Political Behavior: political psychology and socialization; political ideology and values; prejudice and intolerance; public opinion; political participation; political sociology.<br>Methodology: statistics; econometrics; measurement theory and scaling; analysis of covariance structures; multivariate methods; survey research methods; logic of inquiry and research design.</p><h2>Exposing Slavery: Photography, Human Bondage, and the Birth of Modern Visual Politics in America</h2><p>Within a few years of the introduction of photography into the United States in 1839, slaveholders had already begun commissioning photographic portraits of their slaves. Ex-slaves-turned-abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass had come to see how sitting for a portrait could help them project humanity and dignity amidst northern racism. In the first decade of the medium, enslaved people had begun entering southern daguerreotype studios of their own volition, posing for cameras, and leaving with visual treasures they could keep in their pockets. And, as the Civil War raged, Union soldiers would orchestrate pictures with fugitive slaves that envisioned racial hierarchy as slavery fell. In these ways and others, from the earliest days of the medium to the first moments of emancipation, photography powerfully influenced how bondage and freedom were documented, imagined, and contested. By 1865, it would be difficult for many Americans to look back upon slavery and its fall without thinking of a photograph.<br><br><em>Exposing Slavery </em>explores how photography altered and was, in turn, shaped by conflicts over human bondage. Drawing on an original source base that includes hundreds of unpublished and little-studied photographs of slaves, ex-slaves, free African Americans, and abolitionists, as well as written archival materials, it puts visual culture at the center of understanding the experience of late slavery. It assesses how photography helped southerners to defend slavery, enslaved people to shape their social ties, abolitionists to strengthen their movement, and soldiers to pictorially enact interracial society during the Civil War. With diverse goals, these peoples transformed photography from a scientific curiosity into a political tool over only a few decades. <br><br>This creative first book sheds new light on conflicts over late American slavery, while also revealing a key moment in the relationship between modern visual culture and racialized forms of power and resistance.<br></p><p><br><strong>Matthew Fox-Amato</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Idaho. He is a historian of visual and material culture.<br><br>"[An] original, richly illustrated, and brilliant book" -- <em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Matthew Fox-Amato's imaginative book allows us to look into the eyes of the black and white people of nineteenth-century America. His inventive and humane study shows how images emerged from commerce and sentiment, from slavery, abolitionism, and the Civil War, from people capturing themselves for a moment in time. It is a fascinating collective portrait."--Edward L. Ayers, author of <em>The Thin Light of Freedom: Civil War and Emancipation in the Heart of America</em><p></p><br>"<em>Exposing Slavery</em> is a surprising and compelling history of the interconnections between the American embrace of photography in the 1840s and 1850s and rising tensions over slavery. This rare marvel of a book shows how enslaved men and women and abolitionists used the medium to express claims to personhood and build a social movement."--Ann Fabian, President, Society of American Historians<p></p><br>"Deeply researched, cogently argued, and wonderfully theorized, Matthew Fox-Amato's innovative book is the first full-scale examination of the visual archives of slavery, abolition, and emancipation. This book reveals how the medium of photography became a site of political contestation during the age of the Civil War. It is an original and important intervention that must be reckoned with."--Manisha Sinha, author of <em>The Slave's Cause: A History of Abolition</em><p></p><br>"This deeply researched and beautifully written book illuminates how the new medium of photography-invented as the American struggle over slavery reached a fevered pitch-became a tool for political and social change. Fox-Amato doesn't simply use photographs to illustrate his thesis, he builds his original argument from the images themselves, deftly showing how abolitionists and slaveholders, enslaved people and freedmen, alike, all harnessed the new technology to make a persuasive case for their own ideas about personhood, property, and civil rights. The links between photography and American thinking about slavery are so clear here, one wonders how they could have remained hidden in the archives for so long."--Martha A. Sandweiss, author of <em>Print the Legend: Photography and the American West</em><p></p><br>"<em>Exposing Slavery</em> takes a fresh look at the role of photography in 'humanizing' the institution of chattel slavery. Revisiting the archive of slave photography that haunts contemporary representations of the subjection of black bodies in the twenty-first century, the book complicates our understanding of the subjects of these images at a moment when digital imaging has become one of the most important tools in the ongoing battle against antiblack violence. The book provides a significant rebuttal to any assertion that these historical images are simply a reflection of mastery or submission. It tells a very different story that challenges us to look more closely at this troubling and insightful archive."--Tina Campt, author of <em>Listening to Images</em><p></p><br>"As Fox-Amato shows, photography played a significant role in the debates over notions of status, identity, and community, and those boundaries regarding personhood continued well into the following century. A groundbreaking examination of the effect of modernity on established norms."--<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Exposing Slavery</em>, Matthew Fox-Amato, a historian at the University of Idaho, persuasively argues that photography changed Americans' perception of both slavery and the humanity of blacks... No one who reads <em>Exposing Slavery</em> will ever see antebellum and Civil War-era photographs of black Americans in the same way again. Quite apart from the author's thorough research and tight prose, the many accompanying photographs are superlatively reproduced on high-quality paper, making them seem as crisp and striking as the day they were made."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Cogent and compelling... As... Matthew Fox-Amato... reveals, visual technology became a powerful political tool, animating debates about the social identities of African Americans and the ideal racial order of the United States."--Glenn C. Altschuler, <em>Florida Courier</em><p></p><br>"<em>Exposing Slavery</em> is a valuable aid for thinking through this tangle of issues around race, sight, power, and bodies. For Fox-Amato, slavery and the Civil War were central to the development of photography... Fox-Amato tenderly unspools how fundamental photography became to asserting kinship and love for a people whose circumstances unrelentingly reminded them that they possessed no legal rights to either." <br>--Alexis L. Boylan, <em>Boston Review</em><p></p><br>"Beyond providing important historical insights relevant to today's racial and visual politics, it schools us in ways of looking. The arresting reproductions of old photographs call on us to slow down and pay attention. Fox-Amato's cogent exposition of what's on offer in the photographs--what they open up and open on to, if you will--invites us to look more deeply not only into our past but into our present. Add <em>Exposing Slavery</em> to your reading list and your syllabus.

Building on his own ground-breaking work, he analyses the key themes of food, space, place, and culture, showing how equity, justice and inclusion are fundamental to any enduring practical expression of sustainability." (<i>Andrew Dobson, Keele University</i>)<br><br>"With this excellent book, Agyeman both consolidates and advances his ground-breaking work on just sustainabilities. Readers looking for a clear and concise review of the concept and underpinning ideas, as well as those wanting compelling examples of its practical application will be more than satisfied." (<i>Gordon Walker, Lancaster University</i>)<br><br>"With <i>Just Sustainabilities</i>, Agyeman again demonstrates why he is considered one of the world's foremost modern thinkers on the relationship between humanity and nature. By eloquently making the case that the loss of human potential is as detrimental to our future as the loss of environmental potential, Agyeman shows that we need to transform the way we treat each other as well as the planet." (<i>Mark Roseland, Simon Fraser University</i>)<br><br>"There&#x2019;s lots to think about if we want to build cities that are culturally-inclusive and sustainable in the most comprehensive sense of that term. Julian Agyeman brings great passion, intelligence, and imagination to the task, and nicely primes the pump for the rest of us." (<i>Dean Saitta, University of Denver</i>)<br><br>"Agyeman presents the issues involved in the movement, specifically as to how they relate to other social justice movements more focused on race and class. In the process, he provides an important, essential and convincing challenge to modern sustainablity movements and their approach to questions of race and class. It is to his further credit that he presents this challenge in a manner likely to move efforts inside those movements toward a synthesis that encompasses the intent of the movements while expanding the breadth of their base."

Entirely modern in its data and conclusions, it reveals the surprising sophistication of certain areas of early science, particularly Babylonian mathematics. <br>After a discussion of the number systems used in the ancient Near East (contrasting the Egyptian method of additive computations with unit fractions and Babylonian place values), Dr. Neugebauer covers Babylonian tables for numerical computation, approximations of the square root of 2 (with implications that the Pythagorean Theorem was known more than a thousand years before Pythagoras), Pythagorean numbers, quadratic equations with two unknowns, special cases of logarithms and various other algebraic and geometric cases. Babylonian strength in algebraic and numerical work reveals a level of mathematical development in many aspects comparable to the mathematics of the early Renaissance in Europe. This is in contrast to the relatively primitive Egyptian mathematics. In the realm of astronomy, too, Dr. Neugebauer describes an unexpected sophistication, which is interpreted less as the result of millennia of observations (as used to be the interpretation) than as a competent mathematical apparatus. The transmission of this early science and its further development in Hellenistic times is also described. An Appendix discusses certain aspects of Greek astronomy and the indebtedness of the Copernican system to Ptolemaic and Islamic methods.<br>Dr. Neugebauer has long enjoyed an international reputation as one of the foremost workers in the area of premodern science. Many of his discoveries have revolutionized earlier understandings. In this volume he presents a non-technical survey, with much material unique on this level, which can be read with great profit by all interested in the history of science or history of culture. </p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Otto Neugebauer: Exacting History <br></b>Neugebauer's <i>The Exact Sciences in Antiquity</i> became an instant unique classic of scientific literature when first published in 1951 in the United States and in Copenhagen where he had lived and worked for some years after having been forced out of Germany because of his opposition to National Socialism. At the start of World War II, Otto Neugebauer (1899&#x2013;1990) left Europe for Brown University where he founded the History of Mathematics Department. Years later a colleague at Brown recalled Neugebauer's eloquent summary of the dark years in Germany: "If you never heard the sound of Nazi boots below you in the street, you cannot understand the history of the period." </p><p> </p><p>In the 1980s he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He wrote several books and many articles in addition to <i>The Exact Sciences in Antiquity</i>. His monumental three-volume <i>History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy</i> (1975) is the definitive work on the subject. Dover reprinted <i>The Exact Sciences in Antiquity</i> in 1969. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Critical Acclaim for Otto Neugebauer:<br></b>"Otto Neugebauer was the most original and productive scholar of the history of the exact sciences, perhaps of the history of science, of our age. He began as a mathematician, turned first to Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics, and then took up the history of mathematical astronomy, to which he afterward devoted the greatest part of his attention. In a career of sixty-five years, he to a great extent created our understanding of mathematical astronomy from Babylon and Egypt, through Greco-Roman antiquity, to India, Islam, and Europe of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Through his colleagues, students, and many readers, his influence on the study of the history of the exact sciences remains profound, even definitive." &#x2015; N. M.

Drawing on historical records, Robinson argues that Blacks have constructed both a culture of resistance and a culture of accommodation based on the radically different experiences of slaves and free Blacks. Robinson concludes that contemporary Black movements are inspired by either a social vision - held by the relatively privileged strata - which holds the American nation to its ideals and public representation, and another - that of the masses - which interprets the Black experience in America as proof of the country&#39;s venality and hypocrisy.<strong>Cedric J.

The author has performed a distinct service by making this material so conveniently accessible in a single book." &#x2014; <i>Mathematical Review<br></i>Since its initial publication in 1962, Professor Schwerdtfeger's illuminating book has been widely praised for generating a deeper understanding of the geometrical theory of analytic functions as well as of the connections between different branches of geometry. Its focus lies in the intersection of geometry, analysis, and algebra, with the exposition generally taking place on a moderately advanced level. Much emphasis, however, has been given to the careful exposition of details and to the development of an adequate algebraic technique.<br>In three broad chapters, the author clearly and elegantly approaches his subject. The first chapter, Analytic Geometry of Circles, treats such topics as representation of circles by Hermitian matrices, inversion, stereographic projection, and the cross ratio. The second chapter considers in depth the Moebius transformation: its elementary properties, real one-dimensional projectivities, similarity and classification of various kinds, anti-homographies, iteration, and geometrical characterization. The final chapter, Two-Dimensional Non-Euclidean Geometries, discusses subgroups of Moebius transformations, the geometry of a transformation group, hyperbolic geometry, and spherical and elliptic geometry. For this Dover edition, Professor Schwerdtfeger has added four new appendices and a supplementary bibliography.<br>Advanced undergraduates who possess a working knowledge of the algebra of complex numbers and of the elements of analytical geometry and linear algebra will greatly profit from reading this book. It will also prove a stimulating and thought-provoking book to mathematics professors and teachers.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Making Connections: Total Body Integration Through Bartenieff Fundamentals</h2><p>First Published in 2001.

Will temperatures rise by 2�C or 8�C over the next hundred years? Will sea levels rise by 2 or 30 feet? The only way that we can accurately answer questions like these is by looking into the distant past, for a comparison with the world long before the rise of mankind. <br><br>We may currently believe that atmospheric shifts, like global warming, result from our impact on the planet, but the earth's atmosphere has been dramatically shifting since its creation. This book reveals the crucial role that plants have played in determining atmospheric change - and hence the conditions on the planet we know today. Along the way a number of fascinating puzzles arise: Why did plants evolve leaves? When and how did forests once grow on Antarctica? How did prehistoric insects manage to grow so large? The answers show the extraordinary amount plants can tell us about the history of the planet -- something that has often been overlooked amongst the preoccuputations with dinosaur bones and animal fossils. <br><br>David Beerling's surprising conclusions are teased out from various lines of scientific enquiry, with evidence being brought to bear from fossil plants and animals, computer models of the atmosphere, and experimental studies. Intimately bound up with the narrative describing the dynamic evolution of climate and life through Earth's history, we find Victorian fossil hunters, intrepid polar explorers and pioneering chemists, alongside wallowing hippos, belching volcanoes, and restless landmasses.<br></p><p><br>David Beerling is Professor of Palaeoclimatology at the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences University of Sheffield. Before this he held a Royal Society University Research Fellowship, where his work on the evolution of life and the physical environment was recognized by the award of a prestigious Philip Leverhulme Prize in earth sciences (2001). He has published over 100 papers in international scientific journals and is co-author of <em>Vegetation and the Global Carbon Cycle: Modelling the first 400 million years </em>(CUP, 2001).<br><br>"David Beerling is passionate about plants and their roles in shaping the Earth, and this is clearly evident in his book <em>The Emerald Planet</em>. An interesting and enjoyable read."--The Astrobiology Society of Britian<p></p><br>"It would be a useful addition to a biological library, or to one that serves researchers in atmospheric science."--<em>E-STREAMS</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Emerald Planet</em> is beautifully written, fresh and provocative. Beerling is a good teacher, using imaginative analogies to explain complex material that might otherwise seem dry. His book will appeal to amateurs and professionals alike-everyone interested in how plants have changed and will continue to change out world."--Jennifer McElwain, <em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"Throughout the book, Beerling uses evidence from the plant fossil record (mutant spores, tree stumps from the Artic and Antartic, growth rings) to reconstruct past climates and to help explain mass extinctions. Too often this evidence has been disregarded, but Beerling gives it its due, and then some."-- <em>BioScience</em><p></p><br>"Summing up: Highly recommended."-- <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Beerling introduces us to the scientists of the past and their contributions to today's hypotheses.His presentations successfully convey the incremental nature of science demonstrating that new hypotheses often emerge from the combination of observation and syntheses of pervious work."--<em>BioScience</em><p></p><br>"The result is a book that is fascinating and exciting to read."--<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"This book reveals the crucial role that plants have played in determining atmospheric change - and hence the conditions on the planet we know today." -- <em>American Meteorological Society</em><p></p><br>"An excellent reference for students, educators, and research students, this techincal book provides a summary of theories on the influence of plant life on earth and brings to attention the recent discoveries that lead to unraveling its mysteries." -- <em>Current Books on Gardening and Botany</em><p></p><br></p><h2>How to Do Your Research Project: A Guide for Students</h2><p><strong>How to Do Your Research Project</strong> continues to lead the way as an essential guide for anyone undertaking a research project in the applied social sciences.

Racism persists because dominant groups are unwilling to acknowledge, let alone give up, the benefits of whiteness. Through numerous examples, Institutional Racism demonstrates how inequality and racial exclusion are embedded within the fabric of American society. Better explores how racism has restricted equal access to educational opportunities, employment, and housing, and she considers the influence of racism in the criminal justice system. Beyond detailing the sometimes subtle institutional causes and pernicious effects of racism, Better offers numerous strategies for individuals and groups as they seek to combat this pervasive social problem. Institutional Racism is a must read for those whose seek to understand the underpinnings of racism and for everyone interested in the practical possibilities of racial pluralism and equality in the United States.</p><p>Shirley Better is professor emeritus in the School of Social Work at California State University at Los Angeles, where she designed and implemented an upper division theme of six courses focusing Institutional Racism.

Written between 1798 and 1805, the text was intensively revised in Wordsworth's later years. This volume contains the original version of 1805, which was read to Coleridge. The poem was first published in 1850, after the poet's death, and is available in Wordsworth's <em>Poetical Works</em>.

(The Future of Capitalism)</h2><p><p>The Great Financial Crash had cataclysmic effects on the global economy, and took conventional economists completely by surprise. Many leading commentators declared shortly before the crisis that the magical recipe for eternal stability had been found. Less than a year later, the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression erupted. <br><br> In this explosive book, Steve Keen, one of the very few economists who anticipated the crash, shows why the self-declared experts were wrong and how ever&#x2013;rising levels of private debt make another financial crisis almost inevitable unless politicians tackle the real dynamics causing financial instability. He also identifies the economies that have become 'The Walking Dead of Debt', and those that are next in line &#x2013; including Australia, Belgium, China, Canada and South Korea.<br><br> A major intervention by a fearlessly iconoclastic figure, this book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the true nature of the global economic system.</p></p><p><b>Steve Keen</b> is Professor of Economics and Head of the School of Economics, Politics and History at Kingston University.<p>"No one is more qualified than Steve Keen to answer the question "Can we avoid another financial crisis?" with more than a single word. Read this book!"<br><b> &#x2015;Yanis Varoufakis, former Finance Minister of Greece<br><br></b> "In this compelling essay, Steve Keen shows that the "Great Moderation" was in fact a great delusion and documents, to brutal effect, the foolish complacency of mainstream macroeconomists."<br><b> &#x2015;James K. Galbraith, University of Texas at Austin<br><br></b> "Steve Keen explains why the financial crisis it occurred, and why it can't just get better on its own, along its present track. He also explains &#x2013; in a hilarious and absolutely justified takedown &#x2013; why mainstream economists have a "trained incapacity" in being unable to understand why the economy has broken down &#x2013; and hence, why they don&#x2019;t have a real solution. We are still living in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. It&#x2019;s all about debt. But economists fear they will lose their jobs if they say that debts must be written down. Keen asks what is more important: to save the economy, or to save the jobs for economists whose prestige rests on their not understanding why economies are in trouble today."<br><b> &#x2015;Michael Hudson, author of <i>Killing the Host</i> and <i>The Bubble and Beyond<br><br></i></b>"Non-academics interested in economic or financial markets should, if they read ony one book on the topic, absolutely read this one."<b><i><br></i><b>&#x2015;International Investment<br><b><br></b></b></b>"Mr. Keen is surely right to argue that growth fuelled by the continuing expansion of private debt is highly risky for the overall economy, and that which cannot continue indefinitely will come to a sticky end sooner rather than later.

Theory, curriculum, methods, and assessment are woven into a comprehensive model for setting objectives; planning lessons, units, and courses; choosing classroom strategies; and constructing tests for some of the field's most popular and enduring programs. The reflective and integrative framework emphasizes building imagination, insight, and critical thinking into everyday classrooms; encourages problem-solving attitudes and behavior; and provokes analysis, reflection, and debate. The text includes separate chapters on teaching each of the major areas of the social studies curriculum. </p> <p></p> <p>Throughout the text, all aspects of curriculum and instruction are viewed from a tripartite perspective that divides social studies instruction into didactic (factual), reflective (analytical), and affective (judgmental) components. These three components are seen as supporting one another, building the groundwork for taking stands on issues, past and present. At the center is the author's belief that the heart and soul of social studies instruction, perhaps all teaching, lies in stimulating the production of ideas; looking at knowledge from others' viewpoints; and formulating for oneself a set of goals, values, and beliefs that can be explained and justified in open discussion.</p> <p></p><b> </b><p><b>New in the Fourth Edition</b>:</p> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Clear links to the The National Council for the Social Studies College, Career and Civic Life C3 Framework for Social Studies State Standards</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Attention to impact of high-stakes testing, Common Core State Standards, and related ongoing developments</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Expanded and critical review of the use of internet, web, and PowerPoint technologies</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Coverage of how to incorporate the many social science, humanities, and STEM fields to enrich the social studies</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Updates and revisions throughout, including new research reports reflecting current findings, new examples, more media and materials resources, particularly digital resources, new and updated pedagogical features</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Companion Website - new for this edition</li> <p></p></ul></p><p><p><strong>Jack Zevin</strong> is Professor of Social Studies Education at Queens College, City University of New York, USA.</p></p><h2>Student Solutions Manual with Study Guide, Volume 1 for Serway/Vuille&#39;s College Physics, 10th Edition</h2><p>For Chapters 1-14, this manual contains detailed solutions to approximately twelve problems per chapter.

Between 1942 and 1945, they formed a network to smuggle Dutch Jews and others targeted by the Nazis south into France, via Paris, and then to Switzerland. This network became known as the Dutch-Paris Escape Line, eventually growing to include 300 people and expanding its reach into Spain. Led by Jean Weidner, a Dutchman living in France, many lacked any experience in clandestine operations or military tactics, and yet they became one of the most effective resistance groups of the Second World War. Dutch-Paris largely improvised its operations-scrounging for food on the black market, forging documents, and raising cash. Hunted relentlessly by the Nazis, some were even captured and tortured. In addition to Jews, those it helped escape the clutches of the Nazis included resistance fighters, political foes, Allied airmen, and young men looking to get to London to enlist. As the need grew more desperate, so did the bravery of those who rose to meet it.<br><br>Using recently declassified archives, <em>The Escape Line</em> tells the story of the Dutch-Paris and the thousands of people it saved during World War II.

Megan Koreman adds to this literature with a carefully researched and detailed account of one network that never took up arms and yet fought against the Nazis. The study in itself adds to the historiography ... Koreman's approach clearly takes a wide view that encompasses humanitarian resistance and rescue as well as the activities of men and women, perhaps demonstrating how much our understanding and definition of resistance has changed over time.<em>The Escape Line</em> paints a richly detailed portrait of what ordinary people were able to do to help others in extraordinary circumstances." -- Shannon L.

The book sheds new light on Wilhelm&#39;s troubled youth, his involvement in social and political scandals, and his growing thirst for glory, which, combined with his overwhelming nationalism and passion for the navy provided the impetus for a breathtaking long-term goal: the transformation of the German Reich into one of the foremost powers in the world. The volume examines the crucial role played by Wilhelm as Germany&#39;s Supreme War Lord in the policies that led to war in 1914. It concludes by describing the rabid anti-Semitism he developed in exile and his efforts to persuade Hitler to restore him to the throne.</p><p>This is a concise edition of John R�hl&#39;s prize-winning three-volume biography of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.

The authors take a chemical approach, helping students develop an intuitive feeling for concepts, rather than an engineering approach, which tends to overlook the inner workings of systems and objects.<br>Each chapter contains numerous worked-out problems and real-world vignettes involving commercial applications. Topics include the basics of reaction kinetics and rate constants of elementary reactions, reactors for measuring reaction rates and the steady-state approximation, and heterogeneous catalysis. Additional subjects include the effects of transport limitations on rates of solid-catalyzed reactions, microkinetic analysis of catalytic reactions, nonideal flow in reactors, nonisothermal reactors, and reactors accomplishing heterogeneous reactions. Excellent illustrations complement the text, which concludes with three helpful appendices.</p><p>Mark E. Davis is a chemical engineering professor at California Institute of Technology. Robert J.

The twenty-one specially commissioned chapters are written by established scholars from North America and Britain, and represent both traditional and contemporary points of view. The chapters in Part One cover all the methods and approaches currently practised in the academic study of the Bible, while those in Part Two examine the major categories of books in the Bible from the perspective of recent scholarship - e.g. historical books of the Old Testament, Gospels, prophetic literature. Major issues raised are: the relation of modern &#39;critical&#39; study of the Bible to &#39;pre-critical&#39; and &#39;post-critical&#39; approaches; the place of history in the study of the Bible; feminist, liberationist and new historicist concerns; the relation of Christian and Jewish scholarship; and recent interest in the Bible as literature.</p><p><i>The Cambridge Companion to Biblical Interpretation</i>, despite its dry-as-dust title, is a feast of answers to the extremely juicy question, "What does the Bible mean?" Editor John Barton shaped this book of essays as a "progress report on biblical interpretation in the 1990s." He invited leading scholars to provide 10-to-20 page definitions and summaries of recent developments in fields such as feminist interpretation, literary criticism, political reading, and sociological criticism. As Barton notes, there emerges from this book "a perception among many biblical scholars that the newest approaches are also a restoration of something very old." In other words, abstract hyphenates like "historical-critical" are helping scholars, pastors, and tuned-in laypeople learn to read like the fathers and mothers of faith. The fresh perspectives presented here make it possible to return to the Scriptures with renewed openness to the many shades of revelation. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>This book is the first complete guide to the present state of biblical studies.

Catherine Pickstock shows how Platonic philosophy did not assume a primacy of metaphysical presence, as had previously been thought, but a primacy of liturgical theory and practice. The author also provides a significant rethinking of Christian understandings of language, temporal and bodily life, and notions of the presence of God by discussing the Christian understandings of the liturgical practice, especially in the Medieval and pre-Enlightenment era. Through a detailed reading of Plato's <i>Phaedrus,</i> the medieval Roman Rite, and a discussion of the theology of the Eucharist, the book indicates directions for the restoration of the liturgical order. <p>This book will be required reading for all systematic and philosophical theologians and their students, besides being of great interest to liturgists, historians and linguists.

Featuring critical commentaries by notable psychotherapists, the book affords readers the opportunity to read unedited case material by this pioneering -- though often overlooked -- client-centered therapist, and to compare the responses of therapists from diverse orientations. The cases included represent Rogers' work over a 40-year period with clients with a range of presenting problems. Contributing authors, who include practitioners of psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, gestalt, existential, and spiritual models of psychotherapy, as well as client-centered approaches, comment on the strengths and weaknesses of Rogers' approach to each case and evaluate his theoretical assumptions. In all, the volume both honors Rogers' memory and demystifies his contributions to the field. <br></p><p>The Psychotherapy of Carl Rogers gives readers a unique inside view of Rogers&#39; therapy sessions. Presenting actual cases without edits or revision, this book follows sessions from start to finish with Rogers&#39; exact words, illuminating his reflections, interpretations, self-disclosures, and errors. The selected cases span the period from 1946 to 1986 and represent a range of clients - from those suffering from depression, to those dealing with issues of racism, to an individual who was diagnosed as psychotic. The cases illustrate both the consistency with which Rogers attempted to be a keen and respectful listener and the increasing diversity in his response repertoire over the years. After each case is presented, a client-centered therapist elaborates on the session&#39;s strengths, weaknesses, theoretical assumptions, inconsistencies, and notable features. In addition, for the experiential cases in the second section, a practitioner from another orientation - psycho analytic, cognitive-behavioral, spiritual - provides critical commentary. By discussing the similarities and differences between their approaches and the client-centered approach, they offer insight into the advantages and shortcomings of Rogers&#39; model. Furthermore, the contributors represent a diversity of tone and content that reflect the wide-ranging influence of Rogers&#39; model and the many creative ways it can be understood and applied. An important volume for psychotherapists, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses, this book also serves as a text for courses in counseling, psychotherapy, psychology, and client-centered therapy.Barry A.

Built high in the Andes on a seemingly impossible site, Machu Picchu stands as a testament to Early Native Americans and their ability to plan and build. How was it possible to create a mountain-top city complete with running water, drainage systems, food production, and stone structures so advanced they have endured for over 500 years? Authors Kenneth R. Wright and Alfredo Valencia Zegarra explain these and other mysteries, based on their original engineering and scientific research. A fascinating book, Machu Picchu: A Civil Engineering Marvel is a must-have for civil engineers, archeologists, armchair travelers, and tourists alike. An illustrated walking guide and detailed map allow readers to become familiar with each building and pathway, and numerous photographs take readers on a breathtaking pictorial adventure.</p><p>Machu Picchu, the famous "Lost City of the Inca," has fascinated and captivated archaeologists for five centuries. The royal estate of Pachacuti, an Inca ruler, was built in the fifteenth century and abandoned barely more than a century after its construction. How could the "primitive" Inca construct a city on top of a mountain? How could they solve the intricate problems of drainage, of water supply, of architecture? This detailed study of the city's construction is downright spellbinding. The prose may be a little dry-- its authors, with the exception of attorney Wright, are scientists by trade--but it is also clear and precise. The book tells us as much about the practical challenges of building a city as it does about the mysterious Inca, and it should be an immediate hit with armchair archaeologists and fans of the kind of ancient civilization documentaries that are a staple on PBS's <i>Nova</i> .

Wealthy Romans lavished resources on shaping their surroundings to impress their crowds of visitors. The fashions they set were taken up and imitated by ordinary citizens. In this illustrated book, Andrew Wallace-Hadrill explores the rich potential of the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum to offer new insights into Roman social life. Exposing misconceptions derived from contemporary culture, he shows the close interconnection of spheres we take as discrete: public and private, family and outsiders, work and leisure.</p><br><p> Combining archaeological evidence with Roman texts and comparative material from other cultures, Wallace-Hadrill raises a range of new questions. How did the organization of space and the use of decoration help to structure social encounters between owner and visitor, man and woman, master and slave? What sort of "households" did the inhabitants of the Roman house form? How did the world of work relate to that of entertainment and leisure? How widely did the luxuries of the rich spread among the houses of craftsmen and shopkeepers? Through analysis of the remains of over two hundred houses, Wallace-Hadrill reveals the remarkably dynamic social environment of early imperial Italy, and the vital part that houses came to play in defining what it meant "to live as a Roman."</p></p><p><b>Andrew Wallace-Hadrill</b> is Professor of Classics at the University of Reading in England."Winner of the James R.

Ascough, <i>Religious Studies Review</i></b><br><br>"Wallace-Hadrill's book now joins the ranks of the revisionist studies [of Pompeian society], but far surpasses them in the breadth of its vision and the fundamental nature of its challenge to the Maiurian orthodoxy. Wallace-Hadrill belongs to a rare breed, the social historian who has an intimate first-hand knowledge of the archaeological evidence; and this book is a fitting witness to the benefits which such a range of interest can bestow.

Auden: Critical Editions)</h2><p><p>Written in the midst of World War II after its author emigrated to America, "The Sea and the Mirror" is not merely a great poem but ranks as one of the most profound interpretations of Shakespeare's final play in the twentieth century. As W. H. Auden told friends, it is "really about the Christian conception of art" and it is "my Ars Poetica, in the same way I believe <i>The Tempest</i> to be Shakespeare's." This is the first critical edition. Arthur Kirsch's introduction and notes make the poem newly accessible to readers of Auden, readers of Shakespeare, and all those interested in the relation of life and literature--those two classic themes alluded to in its title.</p><p>The poem begins in a theater after a performance of <i>The Tempest</i> has ended. It includes a moving speech in verse by Prospero bidding farewell to Ariel, a section in which the supporting characters speak in a dazzling variety of verse forms about their experiences on the island, and an extravagantly inventive section in prose that sees the uncivilized Caliban address the audience on art--an unalloyed example of what Auden's friend Oliver Sachs has called his "wild, extraordinary and demonic imagination."</p><p>Besides annotating Auden's allusions and sources (in notes after the text), Kirsch provides extensive quotations from his manuscript drafts, permitting the reader to follow the poem's genesis in Auden's imagination. This book, which incorporates for the first time previously ignored corrections that Auden made on the galleys of the first edition, also provides an unusual opportunity to see the effect of one literary genius upon another.</p></p><p><p>"It is wonderful to have this new edition of <i>The Sea and the Mirror</i>, which I have always considered Auden's greatest work written in America and certainly one of the summits of his career. The long speech of Caliban, channeling Henry James, is in itself a marvelment."<b>--John Ashbery</b></p><p>"The most significant of all Auden's unpatriotic Shakespearean forays of the 1940s, <i>The Sea and the Mirror</i> is a work of enormous skill, learning, and intelligence, a stylistic tour de force that is also freakish, polemical, confessional, and open-ended. It is a poem that comes much nearer to being a major salvo in Auden's cultural war with Little Englandism than it does to being the modest academic 'commentary' that on the title page it rather deviously declares itself to be. Arthur Kirsch's edition of this work is a fine addition to the canon of Auden scholarship. This book will fascinate all readers of Auden, and of Shakespeare."<b>--Nicholas Jenkins</b></p><b>Arthur Kirsch</b>, Alice Griffin Professor of English Emeritus at the University of Virginia, is the editor of <i>Auden's Lectures on Shakespeare</i> (Princeton).</p><h2>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo)</h2><p><p><em>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em> provides analysis of the allocation of money between capitalists, landowners, and agricultural workers in Britain.

The testing techniques in this book are as flexible as conventional testing is rigid. And flexibility is needed in software projects in which requirements can change, bugs can become features and schedule pressures often force plans to be reassessed. Software testing is not such an exact science that one can determine what to test in advance and then execute the plan and be done with it. Instead of a plan, intelligence, insight, experience and a "nose for where the bugs are hiding" should guide testers. This book helps testers develop this insight. The techniques presented in this book not only allow testers to go off-script, they encourage them to do so. Don't blindly follow a document that may be out of date and that was written before the product was even testable. Instead, use your head! Open your eyes! Think a little, test a little and then think a little more. This book does teach planning, but in an "on- the-fly while you are testing" way. It also encourages automation with many repetitive and complex tasks that require good tools (one such tool is shipped with this book on the companion CD). However, tools are never used as a replacement for intelligence. Testers do the thinking and use tools to collect data and help them explore applications more efficiently and effectively. </p></p><p><p><strong>Practical tutorial on how to actually do testing by presenting numerous "attacks" you can perform to test your software for bugs.</strong></p><ul><li>Practical approach has little or no theory, but shows real ways effectively test software&#x2014;accessible to beginners and seasoned testers.</li><li>The author is well known and respected as an industry consultant and speaker.</li><li>Uses market leading, and immediately identifiable, software applications as examples to show bugs and techniques.</li></ul><p><i>How to Break Software</i>is a departure from conventional testing in which testers prepare a written test plan and then use it as a script when testing the software.

Niel&#39;s Bohr&#39;s dictum bears witness to the bewildering impact of quantum theory, flying in the face of classical physics and dramatically transforming scientists&#39; outlook on our relationship with the material world. While the theory has been supremely successful in its explanation of some of the major problems in twentieth-century physics, its meaning is nevertheless the subject of unprecedented controversy amongst scientists.</p><h2>The Domestication of the Savage Mind (Themes in the Social Sciences)</h2><p>Current theories and views on the differences in the &#39;mind&#39; of human societies depend very much on a dichotomy between &#39;advanced&#39; and &#39;primitive&#39;, or between &#39;open&#39; and &#39;closed&#39;, or between &#39;domesticated&#39; and &#39;savage&#39;, that is to say, between one of a whole variety of &#39;we-they&#39; distinctions. Professor Goody argues that such an approach prevents any serious discussion of the mechanisms leading to long-term changes in the cognitive processes of human cultures or any adequate explanation of the changes in &#39;traditional&#39; societies that are taking place in the world around us. In this book he attempts to provide the framework for a more satisfactory explanation by relating certain broad differences in &#39;mentalities&#39; to the changes in the means of communication, and specifically to the series of shifts involved in the development of writing. The argument is based upon theoretical considerations, as well as empirical evidence derived from recent fieldwork in West Africa and the study of a wide range of source material on the ancient societies of the Near East.</p><p>Provides a framework for explaining long-term changes in the cognitive processes of human cultures and `traditional&#39; society taking place in the world around us.</p><h2>Torts Stories (Law Stories)</h2><p>This publication provides a student with an understanding of ten leading torts cases, focusing on how the litigation was shaped by lawyers, judges and socioeconomic factors, and why the cases have attained landmark status.

Though this process was certainly a clash of rival economic systems and racial ideologies, it was also a profound spiritual struggle. The fight over Indian Country sparked religious crises among both Natives and Americans. <br><br>In <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em>, Jennifer Graber tells the story of the Kiowa Indians during Anglo-Americans' hundred-year effort to seize their homeland. Like Native people across the American West, Kiowas had known struggle and dislocation before. But the forces bearing down on them-soldiers, missionaries, and government officials-were unrelenting. With pressure mounting, Kiowas adapted their ritual practices in the hope that they could use sacred power to save their lands and community. <br><br>Against the Kiowas stood Protestant and Catholic leaders, missionaries, and reformers who hoped to remake Indian Country. These activists saw themselves as the Indians' friends, teachers, and protectors. They also asserted the primacy of white Christian civilization and the need to transform the spiritual and material lives of Native people. When Kiowas and other Native people resisted their designs, these Christians supported policies that broke treaties and appropriated Indian lands. They argued that the gifts bestowed by Christianity and civilization outweighed the pains that accompanied the denial of freedoms, the destruction of communities, and the theft of resources. In order to secure Indian Country and control indigenous populations, Christian activists sanctified the economic and racial hierarchies of their day.<br><br><em>The Gods of Indian Country </em>tells a complex, fascinating-and ultimately heartbreaking-tale of the struggle for the American West.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer Graber</strong> is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Texas at Austin and an affiliated faculty member in the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program.<br><br>"Garber's book is valuable for the strength of its scholarship Highly recommended." -- L. L. Lovern, Valdosta State University, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Jennifer Graber's <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em> is one the most impressive books I have read in the last few years. <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em> tells a big story with a large cast of players, and yet still manages to focus on the particulars Additionally, it is beautifully written, carefully researched, well-organized, and broad yet nuanced. Most importantly, Graber tells an incredibly important story and offers a significant counter-perspective to how the field typically narrates 19th-century American religion This book is a model piece of scholarship for those working in American religious history and should be on the bookshelves of all in the field. It is a book that hit this reviewer hard and will sit with her for a very long time. Many pages are already dog-eared, have been re-read numerous times, and will be cited for years to come."--Emily Suzanne Clark, <em>Reading</em> <em>Religion</em><p></p><br>"In this important and much-needed book, religion emerges as something quite surprising and new: as a tool of indigenous dispossession and as a means of preserving native sovereignty and cultural autonomy. <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em> uncovers the centrality of religion to what it meant to be a Native American in the 19th-century United States as well as the centrality of Native Americans to the history of religion in America."--Pekka Hmlinen, author of <em>The Comanche Empire</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Gods of Indian Country</em> is American religious history retold with Kiowa Indians at its center. Graber's analysis of Kiowa art forms is riveting and really a path-breaking contribution. While white Americans invoked the Christian God to sanctify their acts of colonial dispossession, Graber argues, Kiowas engaged with new forms of sacred power to defend their land, sovereignty, and peoplehood."--Tisa Wenger, author of <em>Religious Freedom: The Contested History of an American Ideal</em><p></p><br>"Stories addressing the physical violence of colonialism abound. This book does something different. Through painstaking research and soul-cracking interpretive care, Jennifer Graber exposes the terrorism of Christian benevolence. <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em> is an act of history that is also an essential message for our time, showing how kindness has been a shroud used to smother human freedom. But also how people interpret, and create within, their debasement. Required reading."--Kathryn Lofton, Professor of Religious Studies, American Studies, and history, Yale University<p></p><br>"The conquest of the Great Plains was not simply a contest for land but a battle over spirituality as well. In her eloquent and beautifully crafted <em>The Gods of Indian Country</em>, Jennifer Graber highlights the experience of the Kiowa in their collision with an expansive United States, but her study raises questions at the heart of the indigenous encounter with American settler colonialism."--Karl Jacoby, author of <em>Shadows at Dawn: A Borderlands Massacre and the Violence of History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Classics and Contemporary Readings in the Philosophy of Education</h2><p>Now even more affordably priced in its second edition, <em>Classic and Contemporary Readings in the Philosophy of Education</em> is ideal for undergraduate and graduate philosophy of education courses.

We tend to think of the Romans as a pragmatic people with a ruthlessly efficient army, an exemplary legal system, and a precise and elegant language. <em>A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities</em> shows that the Romans were equally capable of bizarre superstitions, logic-defying customs, and often hilariously derisive views of their fellow Romans and non-Romans.<br> Classicist J. C. McKeown has organized the entries in this entertaining volume around major themes--The Army, Women, Religion and Superstition, Family Life, Medicine, Slaves, Spectacles--allowing for quick browsing or more deliberate consumption. Among the book's many gems are:<br>� Romans on urban living:<br> The satirist Juvenal lists "fires, falling buildings, and poets reciting in August as hazards to life in Rome."<br>� On enhanced interrogation:<br> "If we are obliged to take evidence from an arena-fighter or some other such person, his testimony is not to be believed unless given under torture." (Justinian)<br>� On dreams:<br> Dreaming of eating books "foretells advantage to teachers, lecturers, and anyone who earns his livelihood from books, but for everyone else it means sudden death"<br>� On food:<br> "When people unwittingly eat human flesh, served by unscrupulous restaurant owners and other such people, the similarity to pork is often noted." (Galen)<br>� On marriage:<br> In ancient Rome a marriage could be arranged even when the parties were absent, so long as they knew of the arrangement, "or agreed to it subsequently."<br>� On health care:<br> Pliny caustically described medical bills as a "down payment on death," and Martial quipped that "Diaulus used to be a doctor, now he's a mortician. He does as a mortician what he did as a doctor."<br><br> For anyone seeking an inglorious glimpse at the underside of the greatest empire in history, <em>A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities</em> offers endless delights.<br></p><p><br><strong>J.

The European encounter with America had important intellectual consequences: it brought Europeans into contact with new lands and peoples, and in so doing challenged their traditional assumptions about geography, theology, history, and human nature. In addition, America changed Europe&#39;s commercial patterns, promising new opportunities for the expansion of European economic activity and an increase in profits. It also introduced a vast array of new products such as potatoes, tobacco, corn, cocoa, chocolate, and sugar into the lives of millions of Europeans. Moreover, the acquisition by European states of lands and resources in America had important political repercussions as well. It affected their diplomatic relations by bringing about changes in the balance of power within Europe, and fostered the growth of overseas rivalries too.&#34;</p><h2>An Island of English: Teaching ESL in Chinatown</h2><p><p>Newly arrived Chinese immigrant students face the hardest imaginable situation in the classroom: most often, this is the only place where they can listen to and practice English, having little if any opportunity to do so at home. The burden is then on the teacher to further these students' English education and at the same time create a classroom environment that appreciates and respects their culture and language. </p> <p> Danling Fu has experienced these difficulties firsthand as a teacher, as a student, and as a parent. In <i>An Island of English</i>, she brings together her extensive research in New York's Chinatown, where she worked as a literacy consultant at the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Middle School, her personal story as an immigrant, and the stories of her son as an immigrant student. She extends her findings to other immigrant populations and applies her keen research talents to devise practical recommendations for educators and policymakers. </p></p><p><p>"When I started my work in the New York City schools with ELLs," writes Danling Fu, "I identified with students struggling to write in English." A Chinese immigrant, Danling learned to write in English as a graduate student. Her experience continues to motivate her to teach other English learners and to discover effective teaching methods to support them. "Determining the best way to help ELLs develop their writing skills while they were learning English was a puzzle," she writes, but in her latest Heinemann book, Writing Between Languages, she shares insight from a decade's work in schools populated with ELLs, where she "gradually learned - through observing them in classrooms, examining their writing samples, and listening to teachers and students - how ELLs developed as writers in English." Danling is currently Professor of Literacy Education at the University of Florida, and she is the author of two other books with Heinemann: An Island of English and "My Trouble Is My English."</p>&#x201c;Although focused on the Chinese experience, this is a book that shows how to help new language learners from any country through a frank and honest approach.&#x201d;&#x2013;Donald H.

But when one finally notices the "crops" scattered in front of the group, what seemed innocent on first view become horrific skulls and bones. Where are we? Who are the people in the photograph, and what are they doing? <br><br> The starting pointof Jan Tomasz and Irena Grudzinska Gross's <em>Golden Harvest</em>, this haunting photograph in fact depicts a group of peasants--"diggers"--atop a mountain of ashes at Treblinka, where some 800,000 Jews were gassed and cremated. The diggers are searching for gold and precious stones that Nazi executioners may have overlooked. The story captured in this grainy black-and-white photograph symbolizes the vast, continent-wide plunder of Jewish wealth that went hand-in-hand with the Holocaust.<br> <br> The seizure of Jewish assets during World War II occasionally generates widespread attention when Swiss banks are challenged to produce lists of dormant accounts, or national museums are forced to return stolen paintings. But the theft of Europe's Jewish population was not limited to conquering armies, leading banks, or museums. It was perpetrated also by local people, such as those pictured in the photograph. Lyrical and often heartbreaking, <em>A Golden Harvest</em> takes readers across Europe as it exposes the economic ravaging of an entire society. Beginning with a simple group shot, the authors have written a moving book that evokes the depth and range, as well as the intimacy, of the Final Solution.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jan Tomasz Gross</strong> is Professor of History at Princeton University.

In this eye-opening book, Lamin Sanneh examines the roots of this "post-Western awakening" and the unparalleled richness and diversity, as well as the tension and conflict, it has brought to World Christianity.<br><br>Tracing Christianity's rise from its birth on the edge of the Roman empire--when it proclaimed itself to be a religion for the entire world, not just for one people, one time, and one place--to its key role in Europe's maritime and colonial expansion, Sanneh sheds new light on the ways in which post-Western societies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were drawn into the Christian orbit. Ultimately, he shows, these societies outgrew Christianity's colonial forms and restructured it through their own languages and idioms--a process that often occurred outside, and sometimes against, the lines of denominational control. The effect of such changes, Sanneh contends, has been profound, transforming not only worship, prayer, and the interpretation of Scripture, but also art, aesthetics, and music associated with the church. In exploring this story of Christianity's global expansion and its current resurgence in the non-Western world, Sanneh pays close attention to such issues as the faith's encounters with Islam and indigenous religions, as well as with secular ideologies such as Marxism and nationalism. He also considers the challenges that conservative, non-Western forms of Christianity pose to Western liberal values and Enlightenment ideas. <br><br> Here then is a groundbreaking study of Christianity's role in cultural innovation and historical change--and must reading for all who are concerned with the present and future of the faith.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lamin Sanneh</strong>, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Gambia and the scion of an ancient African royal house, was educated on four continents.

This is a splendid achievement." --Philip Jenkins, author of <em>The Next Christendom</em> and <em>The New Faces of Christianity</em><p></p><br>"Been looking for a solid read on the historical advancement of Christianity through the work of missions?

It contains many worked examples that illustrate the theoretical material and serve as models for solving problems. The first two chapters number. Variable. Function and limit. Continuity of a function have been made as short as possible. Some of the questions that are usually discussed in these chapters have been put in the third and subsequent chapters without loss of continuity. This has made it possible to take up very early the basic concept of differential calculus the derivative which is required in the study of technical subjects.

He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book <i>The Evolution of Cooperation</i> has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The <i>Complexity of Cooperation</i> is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field.</p><br><p> The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. <i>The Complexity of Cooperation</i> is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Robert Axelrod's extraordinary book, <i>The Evolution of Cooperation </i>was globally acclaimed for the rich results of its simple model. <i>The Complexity of Cooperation</i> now gathers together the myriad fruits of more than a decade's work, carefully 'complexifying' his initial model.

George Vaillant took on the crucial questions of whether alcoholism is a symptom or a disease, whether it is progressive, whether alcoholics differ from others before the onset of their alcoholism, and whether alcoholics can safely drink. Based on an evaluation of more than 600 individuals followed for over forty years, Vaillant&#x2019;s monumental study offered new and authoritative answers to all of these questions.</p><p>In this updated version of his classic book, Vaillant returns to the same subjects with the perspective gained from fifteen years of further follow-up. Alcoholics who had been studied to age 50 in the earlier book have now reached age 65 and beyond, and Vaillant reassesses what we know about alcoholism in light of both their experiences and the many new studies of the disease by other researchers. The result is a sharper focus on the nature and course of this devastating disorder as well as a sounder foundation for the assessment of various treatments.</p></p><p>George E. Vaillant is Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.&#x201c;<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited</i> is a revised and updated version of [what] was, and still is, regarded as a classic and certainly broke new ground during the 1980s... The new text provides an update based on developments over the past 15 years; and its importance again derives from the fact that almost all the alcohol abusers identified in the first version have been followed up for an additional 15 years to make 50 years in all. It goes without saying that 50-year follow-up studies are few and far between... Vaillant&#x2019;s 50-year follow-up now stands as a milestone within the addiction literature... It is required reading... The data are beautifully presented and described and the conclusions eminently reasonable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John B. Davies</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Educational Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In alcoholism research, where one side regularly parades a new study and the other then vilifies it, Dr. Vaillant&#x2019;s work can be cited approvingly by both.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Not since Jellinek&#x2019;s <i>The Disease Concept of Alcoholism</i>, published in 1960, has there been a wiser, more comprehensive book on alcoholism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Donald Goodwin, M.D.</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Vaillant addresses a number of important issues and questions, which are core prerequisites for achieving more precise knowledge about the causes and consequences of alcohol abuse and dependence... These important issues have been reexamined in a thoughtful and scholarly manner. Dr. Vaillant has added new survey data and information to his current text, and he has also expanded and revised his original interpretations. New and original material is based upon scientific information acquired since publication of the original report...

Second Edition (Texts in Computing)</h2><p>Long ago, when Alexander the Great asked the mathematician Menaechmus for a crash course in geometry, he got the famous reply ``There is no royal road to mathematics.&#x2019;&#x2019; Where there was no shortcut for Alexander, there is no shortcut for us. Still, the fact that we have access to computers and mature programming languages means that there are avenues for us that were denied to the kings and emperors of yore. The purpose of this book is to teach logic and mathematical reasoning in practice, and to connect logical reasoning with computer programming in Haskell. Haskell emerged in the 1990s as a standard for lazy functional programming, a programming style where arguments are evaluated only when the value is actually needed. Haskell is a marvelous demonstration tool for logic and maths because its functional character allows implementations to remain very close to the concepts that get implemented, while the laziness permits smooth handling of infinite data structures. This book does not assume the reader to have previous experience with either programming or construction of formal proofs, but acquaintance with mathematical notation, at the level of secondary school mathematics is presumed. Everything one needs to know about mathematical reasoning or programming is explained as we go along. After proper digestion of the material in this book, the reader will be able to write interesting programs, reason about their correctness, and document them in a clear fashion. The reader will also have learned how to set up mathematical proofs in a structured way, and how to read and digest mathematical proofs written by others. This is the updated, expanded, and corrected second edition of a much-acclaimed textbook.

Andrew Rudalevige argues that such a linear trend is neither at all certain nor necessary for policy promotion. In <i>Managing the President's Program</i>, he presents a far more complex and interesting picture of the use of presidential staff. Drawing on transaction cost theory, Rudalevige constructs a framework of "contingent centralization" to predict when presidents will use White House and/or departmental staff resources for policy formulation. He backs his assertions through an unprecedented quantitative analysis of a new data set of policy proposals covering almost fifty years of the postwar era from Truman to Clinton.</p><br><p> Rudalevige finds that presidents are not bound by a relentless compulsion to centralize but follow a more subtle strategy of staff allocation that makes efficient use of limited bargaining resources. New items and, for example, those spanning agency jurisdictions, are most likely to be centralized; complex items follow a mixed process. The availability of expertise outside the White House diminishes centralization. However, while centralization is a management strategy appropriate for engaging the wider executive branch, it can imperil an item's fate in Congress. Thus, as this well-written book makes plain, presidential leadership hinges on hard choices as presidents seek to simultaneously manage the executive branch and attain legislative success.</p></p><p><p>"This is an impressive piece of work--extremely well written, clear and exhaustive, almost to a fault. Reflecting immense effort and scholarship, it offers presidency scholars new data, new insights, and interesting, often surprising findings. <i>Managing the President's Program</i> will soon take its place as the standard reference for work dealing with presidential-bureaucratic policymaking and its consequences."<b>--Daniel Ponder, University of Colorado</b></p><p>"Andrew Rudalevige has gained access to an exceedingly important and long awaited data set and will be the first one to publish results. He makes a very good case for the importance of centralization and ties this to the growing literature of 'new institutionalism,' an important emerging approach in quantitative studies of the presidency. His book will get considerable and deserved attention."<b>--Steven Shull, University of New Orleans</b></p><b>Andrew Rudalevige</b> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Dickinson College.</p><h2>Research-Inspired Design: A Step-by-Step Guide for Interior Designers</h2><p><p>This textbook/workbook prepares interior design students for understanding how to change their professional practice from a project-based activity to a knowledge-based activity.

Two attempts by the Stuarts to reclaim the throne were easily put down, not through the power of the British military, but through the general apathy of the British people, who were just not in the mood to join in the rebellions enjoyed by the American colonies and the French. Also known as the Age of Enlightenment, this was a time for intellectual growth, as improved literacy rates and the introduction of newspapers paved the way for a more educated middle class. This was also an ideal time for the initial flourishing of the British Empire, as Britain took advantage of its rivals' troubles to further its aims abroad. This comprehensive and authoritative guide takes a thematic approach to eighteenth-century history, covering such topics as domestic politics, religious developments and changes to social demographics. It presents a full picture of an era of reform and growth.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Langford</strong> has been Professor of Modern History, University of Oxford, since 1996; Fellow, and Tutor in Modern History, Lincoln College, since 1970; Chairman and Chief Executive, Arts and Humanities Research Board, since 1998.

Abelson delves into the too-often dismissed problems of interpreting quantitative data and then presenting them in the context of a coherent story about one's research. Unlike too many books on statistics, this is a remarkably engaging read, filled with fascinating real-life (and real-research) examples rather than with recipes for analysis. It will be of true interest and lasting value to beginning graduate students and seasoned researchers alike. <br> <br> The focus of the book is that the purpose of statistics is to organize a useful argument from quantitative evidence, using a form of principled rhetoric. Five criteria, described by the acronym MAGIC (magnitude, articulation, generality, interestingness, and credibility) are proposed as crucial features of a persuasive, principled argument. <br> <br> Particular statistical methods are discussed, with minimum use of formulas and heavy data sets. The ideas throughout the book revolve around elementary probability theory, t tests, and simple issues of research design. It is therefore assumed that the reader has already had some access to elementary statistics. Many examples are included to explain the connection of statistics to substantive claims about real phenomena.<br></p><p>This volume delves into the too-often dismissed problems of interpreting quantitative data and then presenting them in the context of a coherent story about one&#39;s research.Professor Robert P.

On the battlefield, the injuries were shocking, unlike anything those in the medical field had ever witnessed. The bullets hit fast and hard, went deep and took bits of dirty uniform and airborne soil particles in with them. Soldier after soldier came in with the most dreaded kinds of casualty: awful, deep, ragged wounds to their heads, faces and abdomens. And yet the medical personnel faced with these unimaginable injuries adapted with amazing aptitude, thinking and reacting on their feet to save millions of lives. <br><br>In <em>Wounded</em>, Emily Mayhew tells the history of the Western Front from a new perspective: the medical network that arose seemingly overnight to help sick and injured soldiers. These men and women pulled injured troops from the hellscape of trench, shell crater, and no man's land, transported them to the rear, and treated them for everything from foot rot to poison gas, venereal disease to traumatic amputation from exploding shells. Drawing on hundreds of letters and diary entries, Mayhew allows readers to peer over the shoulder of the stretcher bearer who jumped into a trench and tried unsuccessfully to get a tightly packed line of soldiers out of the way, only to find that they were all dead. She takes us into dugouts where rescue teams awoke to dirt thrown on their faces by scores of terrified moles, digging frantically to escape the earth-shaking shellfire. Mayhew moves her account along the route followed by wounded men, from stretcher to aid station, from jolting ambulance to crowded operating tent, from railway station to the ship home, exploring actual cases of casualties who recorded their experiences. <br><br>Both comprehensive and intimate, this groundbreaking book captures an often neglected aspect of the soldier's world and a transformative moment in military and medical history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Emily Mayhew </strong>is a Research Associate at Imperial College and an examiner at the Imperial College School of Medicine. She is a consultant and lecturer to museums including the Wellcome Collection, the Imperial War Museum and the Royal College of Surgeons.<br><br>"[A]nyone with an interest in the First World War would be well advised to consider this book for a fuller understanding of the experience of soldiers wounded on the Western Front."--rmy History<p></p><br>"<em>Wounded</em> is overall an excellent book which belongs on the shelf of every historian of medicine, of World War I, and of Britain; as well as in every academic, medical, and public library. Even more so, it belongs on the reading list of every politician, for it is difficult to imagine how anyone could ever send young people to war after having read it."--<em>The Watermark</em><p></p><br>"This is a beautifully, heartbreakingly told book, extremely well researched, and timely for any time. It wasn't the war that ended all wars, but the view that Mayhew weaves of this war, and all wars, will stay with you." -- <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"Beautifully written, this harrowing trip to the trenches of World War I tells one of medicine's most pivotal chapters with the pace and tension of a novel." -- <em>Discover</em><p></p><br>"This is a fascinating look at the World War I battlefield through the eyes of casualties and medics. Mayhew, an examiner at the Imperial College London School of Medicine who was unsatisfied with largely fictional portrayals of wounded soldiers and their caregivers, set out to construct a more fact-based historical analysis. It's an atypical narrative history, but it shines." --<em>Army</em> magazine<p></p><br>"A singular work... Mayhew develops her unconventional history like a novel... Mayhew's exceptional presentation brings to life unforgettable struggles from a long-ago war, when common men and women rose to uncommon heights of bravery and compassion." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (STARRED REVIEW)<p></p><br>"These voices of battle-resigned, happy, content, afraid, and stoic-give us a history of World War I that we have never quite experienced. VERDICT: A fascinating narrative, taking readers beyond the battles in the trenches to the battles with life and death that followed." -- <em>Library Journal</em> (STARRED REVIEW)<p></p><br>"<em>Wounded</em> combines a fresh-and vital-perspective on World War One, supported by an enviable depth of research. But what elevates Emily Mayhew's book above the many others on the war is the compassion, the well of emotional resonance underpinned by scholarship as easily accessible to the layperson as it is to the academic. It brings the reader closer to a visceral experience of the twentieth century's first and arguably most terrible world war and its lingering human cost. It should be on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to understand the Great War." -- Jacqueline Winspear, author of <em>Maisie</em> <em>Dobbs</em><p></p><br>"A highly readable account... This is an engaging book, written in narrative style because many official documents about the care of the wounded were simply not thought worth keeping, so anecdotal evidence is paramount. They are voices that deserve to be heard." -- <em>Daily Express</em> (UK edition)<p></p><br></p><h2>Up from Slavery: with Related Documents (Bedford Series in History &amp; Culture (Paperback))</h2><p>Detailing how Booker T. Washington rose from slavery to become one of the nation's most prominent orators and educators at the turn of the 20th century, <em>Up from Slavery </em>chronciles the journey through Washington's own words alongside documents that put the book into context.</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

He argues further that even predictive and descriptive economics can be helped by making more room for welfare-economic considerations in the explanation of behaviour.</p><p>In this elegant critique, Amartya Sen argues that a closer contact between welfare economics and modern ethical studies can substantively enrich and benefit both disciplines. He argues further that even predictive and descriptive economics can be helped by making more room for welfare economic considerations in the explanation of behavior, especially in production relations, which inevitably involve problems of cooperation as well as conflict. The concept of rationality of behaviour is thoroughly proved in this context, with particular attention paid to social interdependence and internal tensions within consequentialist reasoning. In developing his general theme, Sen also investigates some related matters; the misinterpretation of Adam Smith&#39;s views on the role of self-seeking; the plausibility of an objectivist approach that attaches importance to subjective evaluations; and the admissibility of incompleteness and of &#39;inconsistencies&#39; in the form of overcompleteness in rational evaluation. Sen also explores the role and importance of freedom in assessing well-being as well as choice. Sen&#39;s contributions to economics and ethics have greatly strengthened the theoretical bases of both disciplines; this appraisal of the connections between the two subjects and their possible development will be welcomed for the clarity and depth it contributes to the debate. These essays are based on the Royer Lectures delivered at the University of California, Berkeley.<b>Amartya Sen</b> is Lamont University Professor at Harvard University.

Moore&#x2019;s now classic <i>Creating Public Value</i> offered advice to public managers about how to create public value. But that book left a key question unresolved: how could one recognize (in an accounting sense) when public value had been created? Here, Moore closes the gap by setting forth a philosophy of performance measurement that will help public managers name, observe, and sometimes count the value they produce, whether in education, public health, safety, crime prevention, housing, or other areas. Blending case studies with theory, he argues that private sector models built on customer satisfaction and the bottom line cannot be transferred to government agencies. The Public Value Account (PVA), which Moore develops as an alternative, outlines the values that citizens want to see produced by, and reflected in, agency operations. These include the achievement of collectively defined missions, the fairness with which agencies operate, and the satisfaction of clients and other stake-holders.</p><p>But strategic public managers also have to imagine and execute strategies that sustain or increase the value they create into the future. To help public managers with that task, Moore offers a Public Value Scorecard that focuses on the actions necessary to build legitimacy and support for the envisioned value, and on the innovations that have to be made in existing operational capacity.</p><p>Using his scorecard, Moore evaluates the real-world management strategies of such former public managers as D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, and Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue John James.</p></p><p>Mark H. Moore is Hauser Professor of Nonprofit Organizations at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Herbert A. Simon Professor of Education, Management, and Organizational Behavior at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He has also been a Visiting Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.&#x201c;The idea that public managers should operate more like business managers gained momentum in the 1980s, and it continues today. Many reformers and politicians insist that managers should identify the 'customers' for public services and measure agency performance. <b>Moore</b>'s new book examines the difficulties in applying this approach to public services, particularly with respect to performance measurement. He argues that private sector methods do not measure the 'public value' created by a wide range of state and local agencies...His case studies demonstrate that it is possible for public managers to incorporate helpful elements of private sector performance measurement, but that it is essential to recognize the special nature of the public value created by public service agencies.<br>&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>M.

In 1997 Positive Behavior Support (PBS) became an important aspect of most schools&#x2019; classroom management system when the amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) became law and required that schools use positive behavioral support and functional behavioral assessment with students with significant behavioral disabilities.&nbsp; Since then, over seven thousand schools have adopted PBS as their primary management plan. </li><li> New Chapter 14 focuses on research-based best practices in classroom management.&nbsp; This chapter provides nine proven strategies for managing classrooms.&nbsp; </li><li> New feature <i>Strategies for Dealing with Difficult Students</i>. Classroom teachers need&nbsp;specific strategies for working with students whose behavior is not changed by the strategies that work for the majority of students.&nbsp; Each model now provides more specific information on how to deal with these difficult students. </li><li> Seven new tables and figures within the text that are designed to give more practical suggestions for using the models. </li><li> Seven new <i>Tips from the Field</i> provided by state teachers of the year. </li> </ul></p><p><p>Carlette Jackson Hardin is Professor of Education at Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, Tennessee.&nbsp; She currently serves as Interim Dean for the College of Education.&nbsp; Dr. Hardin has degrees from Austin Peay State University (B.S., and M.S.) and Vanderbilt (Ed.D.). Dr. Hardin has been active in professional organizations at the state and national level, having served as President of the National Association for Developmental Education.&nbsp; Dr. Hardin has given over 100 keynote addresses, presentations, and workshops at state, regional, and national conferences.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Since 1981, Dr. Hardin has had numerous professional publications and funded grants. Dr. Hardin and Dr. Ann Harris have written a fastback, <i>Managing Classroom Crises</i> for Phi Delta Kappa which was published Spring, 2000.&nbsp; An orientation textbook for adult students, <i>100 Things Every Adult Student Ought to Know</i>, was published in February 2000 by Cambridge Press.&nbsp;&nbsp; She co-authored <i>Capturing Change: Globalizing the Curriculum through Technology</i>, published by Rowman and Littlefield Education.&nbsp; Her most publication is a monograph published by Phi Delta Kappa, <i>Making the Most of Student Teaching</i>.</p><p> A friend, who knew I was writing this text, recently shared a textbook used by her aunt when she was training to be a teacher in the 1930s. The text, <i>Classroom Organization and Control</i> by Jesse Sears, was published in 1928 and left little doubt about the role of the teacher, with chapters devoted to order, discipline, and punishments. The text was a reminder of how much classroom management has changed in the last 70 years. The text from the 1930s is a far cry from many current classroom-management texts that focus less on teacher-centered control and punishment and more on building communities and creating safe learning environments. </p> <p> The purpose of <i>Effective Classroom Management: Models and Strategies for Today's Classrooms</i> is to provide a synthesis of these changing views of classroom management. The text presents 12 models of classroom management that fall into three distinct categories: Classroom Management as Discipline, Classroom Management as a System, and Classroom Management as Instruction. This book is a scholarly review of the research base on classroom management. However, it is written and formatted in a way that is easy for students to read, understand, and apply. </p> <p><b>INTENDED AUDIENCE</b></p> <p> <i>Effective Classroom Management: Models and Strategies for Today's Classrooms</i> is especially appropriate as the sole text for an undergraduate or graduate course on classroom management. In addition, it may be used for staff-development programs for inservice teachers. This text provides a foundation for selecting a model to follow or for the development of an individual classroom-management plan. The content is applicable for teachers and preservice teachers at all levels&#x2014;elementary, middle, and high school. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION</b></p> <p> Chapter 1 provides the theoretical framework of the text, in which a rationale is given for considering classroom management as discipline, as a system, or as instruction. The chapter presents a brief review of the major research in the field, and ends with a discussion of how individual management plans are developed. </p> <p> <i>Part 1.</i> Classroom Management as Discipline presents four models of classroom management. Chapter 2 presents basic behavioral concepts, including a review of B. F. Skinner's theory of operant conditioning. Lee and Marlene Canter's model, Assertive Discipline, is presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 provides a different approach to using behavioral theory in Fredric Jones's model, Positive Classroom Discipline. Chapter 5 presents the work of two theorists, Rudolf Dreikurs and Linda Albert. </p> <p> <i>Part II.</i> Classroom Management as a System highlights four models that are systematic in approach. The changing theories of William Glasser are the focus of Chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents Richard Curwin and Allen Mendler's model, Discipline with Dignity. Chapter 8 focuses on building communities and discusses the theories of Haim Ginott and Alfie Kohn. The research of Carolyn Evertson is the foundation of her model, Classroom Organization and Management Program (COMP), which is presented in Chapter 9. </p> <p> <i>Part III.</i> Classroom Management as Instruction provides four models that have the teaching of prosocial skills as their central focus. The first model, presented in Chapter 10, is Barbara Coloroso's Inner Discipline. Chapter 11 reviews Ellen McGinnis and Arnold Goldstein's model, Skillstreaming. Several approaches to teaching conflict resolution and peer mediation are presented in Chapter 12. Finally, Forrest Gathercoal's model, Judicious Discipline, is the focus of Chapter 13. </p> <p> <i>Part IV.</i> Developing a Personal System provides information to assist the teacher in designing a personal system of classroom management. Chapter 14 provides information for creating a safe learning environment for all students and explores issues related to multicultural and socioeconomic factors, physical and mental disabilities, and at-risk behaviors. Chapter 15 helps the individual teacher combine all elements of classroom management into a comprehensive program. </p> <p><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></p> <p> The following features make <i>Effective Classroom Management: Models and Strategies for Today's Classrooms</i> both instructor and reader friendly: </p> <ul> <li>Information and chapter activities are directly tied to Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) standards. The table on the inside front cover provides the INTASC standards and the chapters in which these standards are addressed.</li> <li>Tips from the Field appear throughout the text. These tips offer sage advice from practicing teachers.</li> <li>Each chapter contains case studies and scenarios that illustrate the concepts presented. Although most of the case studies and scenarios are based on actual events that occurred in typical classrooms, the names of teachers and students are fictitious.</li> <li>Chapter Activities are designed to help readers reflect on the model presented, develop portfolio material, and develop a personal philosophy of classroom management.</li> <li>A glossary of the Key Terms presented in each chapter appears at the end of the text.</li> </ul></p><h2>Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3 (Pragmatic Programmers)</h2><p>This book is for anyone who wants to understand computer programming. You&#39;ll learn to program in a language that&#39; s used in millions of smartphones, tablets, and PCs. You&#39;ll code along with the book, writing programs to solve real-world problems as you learn the fundamentals of programming using Python 3. You&#39;ll learn about design, algorithms, testing, and debugging, and come away with all the tools you need to produce quality code. In this second edition, we&#39;ve updated almost all the material, incorporating the lessons we&#39;ve learned over the past five years of teaching Python to people new to programming. You don&#39;t need any programming experience to get started. First, you&#39;ll get a detailed introduction to Python and to programming. You&#39;ll find out exactly what happens when your programs are executed. Through real-world examples, you&#39;ll learn how to work with numbers, text, big data sets, and files. Then you&#39;ll see how to create and use your own data types. The incremental examples show you the steps and missteps that happen while developing programs, so you know what to expect when you tackle a problem on your own. Inspired by &#34;How to Design Programs&#34; (HtDP), you&#39;ll learn a six-step recipe for designing functions, which helps you as you start to learn the concepts--and becomes an integral part of writing programs by the end. As you learn to use the fundamental programming tools in the first half of the book, you&#39;ll see how to document and organize your code so that you and other programmers can more easily read and understand it. Beyond the basics, you&#39;ll learn how to ensure that your programs are reliable, and how to work with databases, download data from the web automatically, and build user interfaces. Most importantly, you&#39;ll learn how to think like a professional programmer. You&#39;ll need to download Python 3, available from &#34;python.org&#34;. With that download comes IDLE, the editor we use for writing and running Python programs. (If you use Linux, you may need to installPython 3 and IDLE separately.)</p><p><p>Paul Gries has been teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto for more than 15 years.

Are they stretching resources to the breaking point with their growing demands for care? Distinguished economist and legal scholar Richard A. Posner explodes the myth that the United States could be on the brink of gerontological disaster.<br><br><i>Aging and Old Age</i> offers fresh insight into a wide range of social and political issues relating to the elderly, such as health care, crime, social security, and discrimination. From the dread of death to the inordinate law-abidingness of the old, from their loquacity to their penny-pinching, Posner paints a surprisingly rich, revealing, and unsentimental portrait of the millions of elderly people in the United States. He explores issues such as age discrimination in employment, creativity and leadership as functions of age, and the changing social status of the elderly. Why are old people, presumably with less to lose, more unwilling to take risks than young people? Why don't the elderly in the United States command the respect and affection they once did and still do in other countries? How does aging affect driving and criminal records? And how does aging relate to creativity across different careers?</p><p>Aging and Old Age offers fresh insight into a wide range of social and political issues relating to the elderly, such as health care, crime, social security, and discrimination. From their dread of death to the extraordinary law-abidingness of the old, from their loquacity to their penny-pinching, Posner paints a rich, revealing, and unsentimental portrait of the millions of elderly people in the United States. Why are old people, presumably with less to lose, more unwilling to take risks than young people? Why don&#39;t the elderly in this country command the respect and affection they once did and still do elsewhere? How does aging affect driving ability and criminal behavior? And how does it relate to creativity across different careers? Observing that people change both physically and cognitively as they age, Posner suggests that each of us has, in succession, two separate selves - younger and older - with different abilities, interests, and behaviors, an insight that helps clarify a number of issues concerning the elderly.<p><b>Richard A.

Based on the author's own experiences and on stories passed down from generation to generation, the book chronicles the disappearing world&#x2015;and courageous rebirth&#x2015;of this little-understood people. Kayano describes with disarming simplicity and frankness the personal conflicts he faced as a result of the tensions between a traditional and a modern society and his lifelong efforts to fortify a living Ainu culture. A master storyteller, he paints a vivid picture of the ecologically sensitive Ainu lifestyle, which revolved around bear hunting, fishing, farming, and woodcutting. Unlike the few existing ethnographies of the Ainu, this account is the first written by an insider intimately tied to his own culture yet familiar with the ways of outsiders. Speaking with a rare directness to the Ainu and universal human experience, this book will interest all readers concerned with the fate of indigenous peoples.</p><p>An Ainu Memoir.

In this richly illustrated study, Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin offer a theory of mediation for our digital age that challenges this assumption. They argue that new visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film, and television. They call this process of refashioning "remediation," and they note that earlier media have also refashioned one another: photography remediated painting, film remediated stage production and photography, and television remediated film, vaudeville, and radio.</p></p><p>Jay David Bolter is Wesley Chair of New Media and Codirector of the Augmented Media Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.

One of its most powerful capabilities is the built-in support for threads. This makes concurrent programming an attractive yet challenging option for programmers using the Java programming language. This book shows readers how to use the Java platforms threading model more precisely by helping them to understand the patterns and tradeoffs associated with concurrent programming. You will learn how to initiate, control, and coordinate concurrent activities using the class java.lang.Thread, the keywords synchronized and volatile, and the methods wait, notify, and notifyAll.

Written for the advanced Java developer, this book offers a comprehensive tour of leading-edge thinking about parallel coding processes.<p> Within the dozens of techniques and tips offered here, this book accomplishes at least two goals. First, it shows how concurrency is implemented by default within Java, with material on how built-in features (like the <i>synchronized</i> keyword and its memory model) can be expected to perform when dealing with multiple threads. Naturally, Java threads themselves are also covered, including priorities, scheduling, and the like. </p><p> Much of this book looks at ways to improve performance of concurrent code beyond the simple default strategies. After defining criteria for measuring concurrent code (such as safety and "liveness," a measure of running live threads effectively), the book presents dozens of techniques for letting threads work together safely. For the working Java programmer, coverage of patterns that have been implemented in the downloadable <i>java.concurrency</i> package will be the most immediately useful.

If we transport ourselves in thought to those ancient generations of men, we find in each house an altar, and around this altar the family assembled. The family meets every morning to address its first prayers to the sacred fire, and in the evening to invoke it for a lasttime. In the course of the day the members are once more assembled near the fire for the meal, of which they partake piously after prayer and libation. In all these religious acts, hymns, which their fathers have handed down, are sung in common by the family.

Vaclav Smil uses fundamental unifying metrics (most notably for power density and energy intensity) to provide an integrated framework for analyzing all segments of energetics (the study of energy flows and their transformations). The book explores not only planetary energetics (such as solar radiation and geomorphic processes) and bioenergetics (photosynthesis, for example) but also human energetics (such as metabolism and thermoregulation), tracing them from hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies through modern-day industrial civilization. Included are chapters on heterotrophic conversions, traditional agriculture, preindustrial complexification, fossil fuels, fossil-fueled civilization, the energetics of food, and the implications of energetics for the environment. The book concludes with an examination of general patterns, trends, and socioeconomic considerations of energy use today, looking at correlations between energy and value, energy and the economy, energy and quality of life, and energy futures. Throughout the book, Smil chooses to emphasize the complexities and peculiarities of the real world, and the counterintuitive outcomes of many of its processes, over abstract models. <i>Energy in Nature and Society </i>provides a unique, comprehensive, single-volume analysis and reference source on all important energy matters, from natural to industrial energy flows, from fuels to food, from the Earth's formation to possible energy futures, and can serve as a text for courses in energy studies, global ecology, earth systems science, biology, and chemistry. </p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba.

It starts with topics that are already familiar to students (e.g. statically determinate analysis of truss and beam), then move to new and challenging topics (e.g.influence line and statically indeterminate structural analysis). The connection between the subjects are good."<br><br>"This is a very comprehensive textbook. The real strength of the book is Part Three on indeterminate structures and Chapter 10 on symmetry/antisymmetry which is often missing in other texts. Reading the book, one gets the sense that the author has much practical experience in structural analysis and design."</p><h2>Unequal Freedom: How Race and Gender Shaped American Citizenship and Labor</h2><p><p>The inequalities that persist in America have deep historical roots. Evelyn Nakano Glenn untangles this complex history in a unique comparative regional study from the end of Reconstruction to the eve of World War II. During this era the country experienced enormous social and economic changes with the abolition of slavery, rapid territorial expansion, and massive immigration, and struggled over the meaning of free labor and the essence of citizenship as people who previously had been excluded sought the promise of economic freedom and full political rights.</p><p>After a lucid overview of the concepts of the free worker and the independent citizen at the national level, Glenn vividly details how race and gender issues framed the struggle over labor and citizenship rights at the local level between blacks and whites in the South, Mexicans and Anglos in the Southwest, and Asians and haoles (the white planter class) in Hawaii. She illuminates the complex interplay of local and national forces in American society and provides a dynamic view of how labor and citizenship were defined, enforced, and contested in a formative era for white-nonwhite relations in America.</p></p><p>Evelyn Nakano Glenn is Professor of Women&#x2019;s Studies and Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.This is an important and timely book. Evelyn Nakano Glenn has employed an innovative approach to the complex questions she raises by providing a historical overview of trends unfolding at the national level, and then exploring the operation of these trends at more local levels through case studies of the American South, the Southwest, and Hawaii. <i>Unequal Freedom</i> is a very smart and thoughtful synthetic analysis on the vexed questions of race, class, gender, citizenship, and labor in a critical period of U.S. history. (David G. Guti�rrez, University of California, San Diego)<br><br>Glenn has put her finger on the two key institutional sites that have been central to the structuring of both racial and gender inequalities. This makes an important contribution to our knowledge of the working of gender and race in American society. (Sonya O. Rose, University of Michigan)<br><br>Although contemporary scholars often seek the integration of race, class and gender into a single coherent analysis of inequality, Glenn is rare indeed in offering just such a balanced, comprehensive and practical understanding of all three interlocking forms of oppression in American history and politics. Vivid with telling detail and yet sweeping in scope, <i>Unequal Freedom</i> shows how the interplay of gender, race and class shaped actual citizenship and labor markets in the United States, leaving a legacy of inequality that we are far from overcoming today. The similarities and differences among the South, Southwest and Hawaii provide a convincing picture of how local conditions produce specific forms of class, gender and race relations. The attention Glenn gives not only to such structures but to the varied patterns of resistance by different groups in particular settings also greatly enriches our historical understanding of what is now sometimes mistakenly seen as a new politics of identity. (Myra Marx Ferree, University of Wisconsin)<br><br><i>Unequal Freedom</i> delivers the goods on scholars' longstanding promises to study race, class, and gender as they were actually experienced in the U.S. past, in all of their dynamic interplay and regional particularity. It is a work of breathtaking synthesis and deep originality. The emphasis on both labor markets and on substantive rights of citizenship allows Evelyn Nakano Glenn to set local stories in which quite different demographics of race are at play in national and global contexts. This book changes how we teach about the centrality and variety of inequality in U.S. history. Indeed, it changes how we think about those critical questions. (David Roediger, University of Illinois)<br><br>A hugely capacious and penetratingly insightful work, <i>Unequal Freedom</i> shows how race and gender are inseparable in the constitutions and consequences of citizenship and labor. And with equal attention to national and local spaces, historical and contemporary times, and repressive and resistant forces, this book exemplifies the kind of scholarship that can transform our thinking and our lives. (Gary Y. Okihiro, Columbia University)<br><br>In this astonishingly versatile work of synthesis and analysis, Evelyn Nakano Glenn situates local knowledges on a national stage to explain how citizenship was differently achieved for different Americans. <i>Unequal Freedom</i> uncovers complex intersecting patterns of racial and gender stratification and labor hierarchies and reveals how they are reinforced by the men and women who live them. This is a powerful and provocative book: a sparkling achievement. (Alice Kessler-Harris, Columbia University)<br><br>Although the US has long professed its commitment to universal equality, it remains a society in which gender and race limit opportunities. By exploring the operation of citizenship and labor, Glenn...seeks to explain the persistence of inequality in US society. She provides a comparative analysis of the interaction of racial and gender relations in three settings: the South, the Southwest, and Hawaii. Each of these regions used race and gender hierarchies to structure labor markets and define citizenship to exclude segments of the labor force from the benefits of educational opportunities and political rights...This important, multifaceted analysis interweaves gender, race, and class in an innovative approach that is sensitive to various facets of citizenship as well as to formal and informal methods of exclusion. Glenn moves easily between national structures and local dynamics, drawing attention to the "multiple levels at which efforts for change are needed" if the US is to live up to its promise of universal equality. Highly recommended. (K. Fones-Wolf <i>Choice</i> 2003-01-01)<br><br>Pointing to the "worker citizen" as central to what it means to be "American", Glenn makes a major contribution to the study of racial and gender oppression by examining the linkages between labor and citizenship in American society...While this is a work of American history, the analysis has international appeal, as readers will want to consider the connections between labor and citizenship in their national contexts...Glenn challenges her audience to think about racism and sexism systematically, and not as individual beliefs and attitudes...With the rise of global labour markets, analyses of the connections between labor and citizenship commenced by this excellent work is likely to remain important task in public policy debates. (Sandra Tam <i>Canadian Woman Studies</i> 2004-11-01)<br><br>Although many scholars have called for stronger theoretical ties between race and gender, few have substantively engaged in an analysis that contributes to this task. Evelyn Nakano Glenn succeeds in doing this analysis...Glenn's work meets the difficult challenge of analyzing discourses that are often hidden from dominant modes of thinking and understanding. This contribution makes her work compelling and important to our discipline. (Erin McNeal Reser <i>Rhetoric and Public Affairs</i>)</p><h2>Metaphor and Religious Language</h2><p>Christian theology has suffered in modern times from an inability to explain its traditional reliance on metaphor to an audience intellectually formed by empiricism. The author argues that what is needed is not a more "literal" theology, but a better understanding of metaphor. Soskice offers here an account of metaphor and religious language that not only illuminates the way in which theists speak of God, but also contributes to our understanding of the workings of metaphor in scientific theory and other disciplines.<br></p><p><br>"A splendid vindication of analytic philosophy."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"An extraordinary account of the metaphorical character of religious language."--<em>Commonweal</em><p></p><br>"Combines two excellent studies: the first is a critical analysis of theories of metaphor and topics in contemporary philosophy of language....the second is an examination of the way in which models and the metaphorical language based on them are understood in a critical realism concerning scientific explanation, and so can support the possibility of a critical realism in theology....Deserves to be widely read."--<em>The Thomist</em><p></p><br>"Presents a clear, concise and forceful challenge to anti-realist views of religious discourse."--<em>Review of Metaphysics</em><p></p><br>"I have little but praise for this study.

Written with bracing wit and a refreshing lack of pretense, this new edition has been completely revised and sharpened, and nearly 300 new words and phrases have been added. Whether you are a student, physician, or word connoisseur, a delightful reading experience awaits.</p><p>Understanding medical terminology can be a challenge. There are several excellent comprehensive medical dictionaries available, but they provide only brief information about the origins of the words that they define. Serious students of language will want more depth. This title is a delightful supplement to the traditional dictionary of medical terms. It is a revision of Haubrich's <i>Medical Meanings, </i>published by Harcourt in 1984, which was itself an update of Henry Alan Skinner's <i>Origin of Medical Terms </i>(Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1961).<p>The book has approximately 3,000 entries arranged in two columns per page. Arrangement is alphabetical with a few exceptions: broad categories such as colors, numbers, and phobias are grouped together under one heading. The entry headings are in boldface, and words within the entry in languages other than modern English are in italics. Greek terms are transliterated. Neither syllabication nor pronunciation is provided. The introduction contains instructions for using the book, a Greek transliteration table, and an invitation to send suggestions for improving the work to the author.</p><p>The entries are short etymological essays tracing the history of the word and offering witty comments. <i>Hysterectomy,</i> literally "cutting the uterus," leads to a discussion of Plato's belief that the uterus was an animal roaming freely within the female body and causing moodiness. The author states, "a safe assumption is that this notion was proclaimed and promoted, in the main, by men. From this anatomic designation comes the term hysteria, a term doubtless conceived by a confirmed male chauvinist."</p><p>Changes from the 1984 edition include some added terms and some revision to existing entries. Among the new terms are <i>APACHE</i> (an acronym for a means of evaluating critically ill patients), <i>kuru,</i> and<i> REM</i>. <i>Ascorbic acid </i>and <i>masochism </i>are among the entries that have been revised. A few entries, such as <i>Saint Vitus Dance</i>, have been dropped.</p><p>Although this is a small volume--the twenty-eighth edition of <i>Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary</i> (Saunders, 1994) has 115,000 entries--it makes a unique contribution to medical reference by focusing on history and etymology rather than clinical usage. Students of linguistics will find it as useful as students of the health sciences. Those who want more than a definition will find the book enjoyable and entertaining. It is an excellent companion to traditional dictionaries. Since this is one type of medical book in which currency is not critical, libraries owning the 1984 edition may elect not to update unless the title is heavily used. <i></i></p>Originally published in 1984, this etymology of over 2000 medical terms has been heavily revised for its first edition with a new publisher. Each entry consists of a 50- to 100-word description, usually tracing the term to its old English, Latin, or Greek root. Dates are rarely given for the etymologies, so the reader does not know when or where the term was actually coined. Since definitions of the terms are not included, a general reader may need to use this book in conjunction with a standard medical source such as Stedman's Medical Dictionary (Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1995. 26th ed.). Written by a physician fascinated with words rather than by a lexicographer, this book is very interesting but not vital to any collection; Henry Skinner's Origin of Medical Terms (1961. o.p.) is still a better source.?Eric D.

According to Donald L. Elliott, however, zoning often discourages the very development that bigger cities need and want. In fact, Elliott thinks that zoning has become so complex that it is often dysfunctional and in desperate need of an overhaul. <i>A Better Way to Zone</i> explains precisely what has gone wrong and how it can be fixed.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>A Better Way to Zone</i> explores the constitutional and legal framework of zoning, its evolution over the course of the twentieth century, the reasons behind major reform efforts of the past, and the adverse impacts of most current city zoning systems. To unravel what has gone wrong, Elliott identifies several assumptions behind early zoning that no longer hold true, four new land use drivers that have emerged since zoning began, and basic elements of good urban governance that are violated by prevailing forms of zoning. With insight and clarity, Elliott then identifies ten sound principles for change that would avoid these mistakes, produce more livable cities, and make zoning simpler to understand and use. He also proposes five practical steps to get started on the road to zoning reform.<br> &nbsp;<br> While recent discussion of zoning has focused on how cities should look, <i>A Better Way to Zone</i> does not follow that trend. Although New Urbanist tools, form-based zoning, and the SmartCode are making headlines both within and outside the planning profession, Elliott believes that each has limitations as a general approach to big city zoning. While all three trends include innovations that the profession badly needs, they are sometimes misapplied to situations where they do not work well. In contrast, <i>A Better Way to Zone</i> provides a vision of the future of zoning that is not tied to a particular picture of how cities should look, but is instead based on how cities should operate.</p><p>Donald L. Elliott is an attorney and city planner with extensive experience in real estate and land use planning. He is a senior consultant in the Denver, Colorado, office of Clarion Associates, a national land-use and real estate consulting firm. Elliott is a Fellow of the American Institute of Certified Planners and a former project director for downtown and Gateway zoning for the City and County of Denver. <br>"<i>A Better Way to Zone</i> just may be the best book on planning and zoning since <i>The Zoning Game</i> was published in 1966. Elliott's analysis of the politics, economics, law, techniques, and process of land development and zoning in America today is informed by his nationally distinguished career as a planner and attorney in the trenches of modern zoning. The book's final chapters should be required reading for anyone who believes that zoning should actually be about the 'general welfare.' A highly readable, informative, and insightful book&#x2014;it is a remarkable contribution to this field." (Edward H. Ziegler <i>Professor of law, University of Denver</i>)<br><br>"Sometimes you find a book that you wish you could give to everyone you work with. <i>A Better Way to Zone</i> is such a book. It is a must-read for every professional planner, planning student, planning commissioner and city councilperson. This book clearly explains how we got to where we are today and provides a roadmap to the future of land use regulation. Mr. Elliot brings together his broad knowledge of planning law and an international perspective to provide us with a unique insight to our future." (Frank Gray <i>Frank Gray, Planning Director, City of Scottsdale</i>)<br><br>"Author Don Elliott was very involved in the planning of the Gateway project in Denver. He used this experience to formulate a plan for reforming the American zoning system to make it more responsive to the needs of citizens, and to build more sustainable cities. Throughout the book, he retraces the history, legal context, and development of our current Euclidean zoning system. Zoning is clearly explained in very readable language and exposed for its misconceptions, and Elliott makes a clear case for an overhaul of our zoning laws. He lays out a five-step plan based on ten principles of reform that will transform the way towns and neighborhoods are developed throughout the country." (<i>City Matters Bulletin</i>)<br><br>"Urban zoning has become too strict with too many rules&#x2014;and something has got to change, according to Donald Elliott. He's been a zoning and land-use consultant for 24 years, and works for Clarion Associates in Denver as an attorney and consultant.In Elliott's recently published book, <i>A Better Way to Zone: Ten Principles to Create More Livable Cities</i> he outlines how he thinks the rules should change." (<i>Denver Business Journal</i>)<br><br>"Elliott's concise accounts of the origins and logic of most cities' 'Euclidean Hybrid Zoning' would serve as a good primer on the subject for students or citizens new to the field...I think the mantra about simplicity is the most important part of the book, and completely agree with Elliott that 'the more the public knows, the better they can participate at the policy- and rule-making level.' Let's hope his call for simplicity and transparency is heeded."

The medieval period produced literature in Castilian, Catalan, Galician, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew, and today there is a flourishing literature in Catalan, Galician, and Basque as well as in Castilian--the language that has became known as "Spanish." Moreover, a multilayered history of exile has produced a transnational literary output, while writers in Spain have engaged with European cultural trends. This <em>Very Short</em> <em>Introduction</em> explores this rich literary history, which resonates with contemporary debates on transnationalism and cultural diversity. The book sheds much light on the ways in which Spanish literature has been read, in and outside Spain, explaining misconceptions, outlining the insights of recent scholarship, and suggesting new readings. It highlights the precocious modernity of much early modern Spanish literature, and shows how the gap between modern ideas and social reality stimulated creative literary responses in subsequent periods and how contemporary writers have adjusted to Spain's recent accelerated modernization.<br></p><p><br>Jo Labanyi is Professor of Spanish and Director of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at New York University, having previously held chairs at the University of London (where she directed the Institute of Romance Studies from 1997-2002) and University of Southampton.<br></p><h2>Morality and the Human Goods: An Introduction to Natural Law Ethics</h2><p>A concise and accessible introduction to natural law ethics, this book introduces readers to the mainstream tradition of Western moral philosophy. Building on philosophers from Plato through Aquinas to John Finnis, Alfonso G�mez-Lobo links morality to the protection of basic human goods&#x2015;life, family, friendship, work and play, the experience of beauty, knowledge, and integrity&#x2015;elements essential to a flourishing, happy human life. <br><br>G�mez-Lobo begins with a discussion of Plato's Crito as an introduction to the practice of moral philosophy, showing that it requires that its participants treat each other as equals and offer rational arguments to persuade each other. He then puts forth a general principle for practical rationality: one should pursue what is good and avoid what is bad. The human goods form the basis for moral norms that provide a standard by which actions can be evaluated: do they support or harm the human goods? He argues that moral norms should be understood as a system of rules whose rationale is the protection and enhancement of human goods. A moral norm that does not enjoin the preservation or enhancement of a specific good is unjustifiable. Shifting to a case study approach, G�mez-Lobo applies these principles to a discussion of abortion and euthanasia. The book ends with a brief treatment of rival positions, including utilitarianism and libertarianism, and of conscience as our ultimate moral guide. <br><br>Written as an introductory text for students of ethics and natural law, <i>Morality and the Human Goods </i>makes arguments consistent with Catholic teaching but is not based on theological considerations. The work falls squarely within the field of philosophical ethics and will be of interest to readers of any background.</p><p><b>Alfonso G�mez-Lobo</b> is Ryan Professor of Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy at Georgetown University.<p>"A careful reconstruction and rigorously argued defense of what was once, and may yet be again, the mainstream western tradition of thought about morality.

The book was a landmark work in the history and economics as it was comprehensive and an accurate characterization of the economic mechanisms at work in modern economics. Smith believed in a Meritocracy. Smith emphasized the advancement that one could take based on their will to better themselves. This is simply one of the most important books ever written on the subject of economics. All five books are included here. A Thrifty Book is a well designed, easy to read book at an unbeatable price.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s masterpiece, first published in 1776, is the foundation of modern economic thought and remains the single most important account of the rise of, and the principles behind, modern capitalism. Written in clear and incisive prose, The Wealth of Nations articulates the concepts indispensable to an understanding of contemporary society; and Robert Reich&#39;s new Introduction for this edition both clarifies Smith&#39;s analyses and illuminates his overall relevance to the world in which we live. As Reich writes, &#34;Smith&#39;s mind ranged over issues as fresh and topical today as they were in the late eighteenth century--jobs, wages, politics, government, trade, education, business, and ethics.&#34;"Adam Smith's enormous authority resides, in the end, in the same property that we discover in Marx: not in any ideology, but in an effort to see to the bottom of things."<br>--Robert L.

What is it like to be somebody else? What if tomorrow never comes? Is the world around us real? Your students will be asking these challenging questions and more after reading and completing the activities in <i>More Philosophy for Teens</i>. A companion to the best-selling <i>Philosophy for Teens</i> book, this volume tackles the topics of reality and knowledge in a teenager-friendly format. <br><br>The authors examine some of life's toughest questions, including identity, God, the universe, freedom, and the meaning of life. Both sides of the debates are covered on every issue, with information from some of the world's most noted philosophers included in a conversational style that teenagers will love.</p><p>For the past several years, Sharon M. Kaye, Ph.D., and Paul Thomson, Ph.D., taught philosophy to high school students through the Carroll-Cleveland Philosopher&#39;s Program, which won the 2006 American Philosophical Association Award for Excellence and Innovation in Philosophy Programs. They continue to promote the teaching of philosophy to secondary students. Philosophy, the authors believe, allows students to formulate intelligent opinions on major life issues; therefore, their book asks students to make reasoned, informed decisions about some of life&#39;s greatest debates. Kaye currently serves as an associate professor of philosophy at John Carroll University in Cleveland, OH. Thomson currently serves as Philosopher-in-Residence at Columbia Secondary School, a magnet school in New York City, where he coordinates the school&#39;s philosophy courses.</p><h2>Europe, 1648-1815: From the Old Regime to the Age of Revolution</h2><p>In 1648, Europe was reeling from the destabilizing effects of religious conflict, economic change, and social upheaval. The issues that divided the Church in the late Middle Ages had forced Europeans to choose sides in a bitter and bloody Catholic/Protestant conflict. A powerful capitalist movement had broken down old social ties, leading to the near disappearance of serfdom in Western Europe and to the formation of a larger merchant class in the cities. The discoveries of the Scientific Revolution had begun to corrode old certainties about the universe, just as the exploration of the New World was revealing the existence of peoples, cultures, and even continents that would have been unimaginable to previous generations. In the face of such chaos, which led many to fear that society was heading towards an utter breakdown, the European elite engaged in a desperate effort to restore order. Between 1648 and 1750, peoples and governments throughout Europe sought to contain the shift toward anarchy through the reinforcement of religious orthodoxies, the strengthening of national states, and the stiffening of social hierarchies. But by the later eighteenth century, the success of this effort led paradoxically to new institutional and intellectual demands for change. The search for order had given way to a quest for progress. A new movement known as "the Enlightenment" was transforming the old order, and revolution was about to become a Western tradition. <br> <em>Europe, 1648-1815</em> is a concise narrative of this fascinating epoch in European history. Framing the events of the period in terms of two successive movements--the search for order and the pursuit of reform--this book surveys the political, economic, social, and cultural events of the period, from the rise of absolutism to the campaigns of Napoleon, from the creation of European empires in the Americas to the controversies of the Enlightenment. With numerous selections from primary sources, a detailed and updated bibliography, a chronology of the period, and numerous illustrations, <em>Europe,</em> <em>1648-1815</em> is indispensable for courses on Early Modern Europe. It can be used as a stand-alone textbook or in conjunction with supplementary readings.<br></p><p>Robin W. Winks is at Yale University. Thomas E.

Now fully revised in its second edition, <em>Environmental Economics</em> is divided into four primary sections: the first section defines the field of environmental economics in relation to general economics and to ecological and resource economics; the second section is normative, looking at market failure and asks why, even with apparent environmental protection, the market often fails to work properly; the third section is positive, examining government regulation of pollution using the industrial organization literature; and the final section covers more advanced topics, looking at risk, uncertainty, green accounting, international competition and cooperation and development. <br><br>Including many international examples, the book places special emphasis on the ways that countries around the world approach and control their own environmental problems. <em>Environmental Economics</em>, Second Edition, is ideal for undergraduate economics courses and beginning graduate courses in environmental management.<br><strong>New to this Edition</strong><br>* Utilizes a new structure: the first part is normative, the second part positive<br>* Provides an updated treatment of valuation and moves it to the first part of the text<br>* Substantially revises coverage of cost-benefit analysis, property rights, and market failure, resulting in greater clarity<br>* Includes new chapters on voluntary environmental protection and additional sections on discounting and dynamics<br>* Offers increased coverage of open access resources and fisheries<br>* The technical level throughout the text is much more consistent from chapter to chapter<br></p><p><br><strong>Charles D.

Good for advance undergraduate and graduate economics courses. Organization and coverage of material is outstanding. Students need a calculus background. Good problem sets."--George Parsons, University of Delaware<p></p><br>"This book is the thinking economist's guide to environmental issues. It gives students with a passion for the subject the tools to think about environmental choices like an economist...If I were to teach this course again, I'd almost certainly adopt the second edition.

The new version includes a chapter and problems on computational techniques, addresses current environmental concerns and trends.<ul><li>Updates and expands the scope of Hillel's prior works, <i>Fundamentals of Soil Physics</i> (1980)and <i>Applications of Soil Physics</i> (1980)</li><li>Explores the wide range of interactions among the phases in the soil and the dynamic interconnections of the soil with the subterranean and atmospheric domains</li><li>Draws attention to historical and contemporary issues concerning the human management of soil and water resources</li><li>Directs readers toward solution of practical problems in terrestrial ecology, field-scale hydrology, agronomy, and civil engineering</li><li>Incorporates contributions by leading scientists in the areas of spatial variability, soil remediation, and the inclusion of land-surface processes in global climate models</li></ul></p><p>Written by an eminent scientist known for his seminal contributions to the field and for his definitive publications, <i>Environmental Soil Physics</i> is a comprehensive, fundamental, and accessible guide to the physical principles and processes governing the behavior of soil and its vital role in both natural and managed ecosystems. Based on sound theory and practical field experience, the book describes the soil as a central link in the continuous chain that constitutes the terrestrial environment; a medium that generates and sustains life, while serving to recycle waste products. It reveals how the functioning of the soil can be affected-for better or worse-by human action. <i>Environmental Soi Physics</i> defines and describes the dynamic cycles of energy, water, solids, solutes, mineral, gases, and living organisms in the soil. It is self-contained and self-explanatory, with numerous illustrations and sample problems, up-to-date references, and relevance to real-world conditions.Born in California and raised in Israel, Dr. Daniel Hillel acquired an early and lifelong love of the land and a commitment to understanding and protecting the natural environment. Through decades of work in some thirty countries, he has become an international authority on sustainable management of land and water resources. Dr. Hillel has served as professor of soil physics, hydrology and the environmental sciences at leading universities in the U.S. and abroad, and has been a consultant to the World Bank and the United Nations. Among the honors he has received are the Chancellor&#39;s Medal for Exemplary Service at the University of Massachusetts , a Guggenheim award, and Doctorates of Science honoris causa by Guelph University of Canada and Ohio State University .

Assuming no prior knowledge of Christian theology or history, it offers students in one volume, a rich and diverse selection of material. The work offers substantial introductions to each text under discussion, along with study questions to assist interaction with texts. 'Study Panels' embedded in the text offer easy access to critical information about the writers and their texts. <br> <p>The pieces included fall into three broad categories: works of literature specifically written to serve the needs of Christians - such as prayers, devotional works, and sermons; works of literature, such as stories and poems, which are not specific to the Christian faith, but which have been shaped or influenced by Christian ideas, values, images, and narratives; and works of literature which interact with Christian ideas, individuals, schools of thought, or institutions, such as novels by George Eliot and Thomas Hardy.<br> </p> <p>The anthology is primarily concerned with the Christian literature of the English language (including Old English and Middle English), although it also includes material relating to the patristic period originally written in Greek, Latin and Syriac, and medieval and Renaissance works in Latin. Substantial sections of writings are included, rather than brief excerpts, to allow readers to really enter the mind of the author represented. The material is divided into five chronological sections stretching from the patristic period to the modern period, and within each section authors are also arranged chronologically. Considerable care has been taken to ensure that the work avoids denominational bias.</p></p><h2>Gravity from the Ground Up: An Introductory Guide to Gravity and General Relativity</h2><p>This book provides an accessible introduction to astronomy and general relativity, aiming to explain the Universe, not just to describe it.

What if something like bankruptcy&#x2015;a fresh start for debtors&#x2015;were available to people convicted of crimes? Martha Minow explores the complicated intersection of the law, justice, and forgiveness, asking whether the law should encourage people to forgive, and when courts, public officials, and specific laws should forgive.</p><p>Who has the right to forgive? Who should be forgiven? And under what terms? Minow tackles these foundational issues by exploring three questions:</p><ul><li>What does the international response to child soldiers teach us about the legal treatment of juvenile offenders in the United States?</li><li>Why are the laws surrounding corporate debt more forgiving than those governing American student and consumer debt, and sovereign debt in the developing world?</li><li>When do law&#x2019;s tools of forgiveness, amnesties, and pardons strengthen justice, peace, and democracy (think South Africa), and when do they undermine law&#x2019;s promise of fairness (think Joe Arpaio)?</li></ul><p>There are certainly grounds for both individuals and societies to withhold forgiveness, but there are also cases where letting go of legitimate grievances can make the law more just, not less. The law is democracy&#x2019;s girder beam, and Minow urges us to build forgiveness into the administration of our laws. Forgiveness, wisely exercised, can strengthen law, democracy, and respect for the humanity of each person.</p></p><p>Martha Minow is the 300th Anniversary University Professor and former dean of the Harvard Law School. She has been examining and writing about law and forgiveness for decades, beginning with the Independent International Commission on Kosovo and the Imagine Coexistence program for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&#x201c;In a world of noise and confusion, animated by vengeance, Martha Minow is a voice of moral clarity: a lawyer arguing for forgiveness, a scholar arguing for evidence, a person arguing for compassion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jill Lepore, best-selling author of <em>These Truths</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;No one but Martha Minow could have written this brilliant, and brilliantly readable, meditation on the role of forgiveness in the law and of the law in forgiveness...[showing how] to move forward and rebuild while both remembering the past and getting past it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Laurence Tribe, author of <em>To End a Presidency</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;May one be pardoned and retain the offense?&#x2019; (<em>Hamlet</em>). In a book at once compassionate, nuanced, and tough-minded, Martha Minow brings together in an illuminating conjunction a set of issues that at first glance seem to have nothing whatever in common: horrific crimes committed by child soldiers, corporate and student debt, and presidential pardons for unrepentant criminals. All of these, as Minow brilliantly shows, raise the same pressing and contentious question: For what offenses and under what conditions should a just legal system offer forgiveness? This is a legal minefield through which <em>When Should Law Forgive?</em> provides an indispensable guide.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Greenblatt, Pulitzer Prize winner</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this time, so shaped by reactionary and &#x2018;call-out&#x2019; cultures that foster harsh, virtue-signaling condemnation of others, this brilliant book carries a profound reminder: for a diverse society to cohere as a humane society, it has to have the capacity&#x2015;rooted in law&#x2015;to forgive and reconcile.

So an actor needs precise exercise and clear understanding to liberate his hidden possibilities and to learn the hard task of being true to the &#39;instinct of the moment&#39;. As her book points out with remarkable persuasiveness &#39;technique&#39; as such is a myth, for there is no such thing as a correct voice. There is no right way--there are only a million wrong ways, which are wrong because they deny what would otherwise be affirmed. Wrong uses of the voice are those that constipate feeling, constrict activity, blunt expression, level out idiosyncrasy, generalize experience, coarsen intimacy. These blockages are multiple and are the results of acquired habits that have become part of the automatic vocal equipment; unnoticed and unknown, they stand between the actor&#39;s voice as it is and as it could be and they will not vanish by themselves. So the work is not how to do but how to permit: how, in fact, to set the voice free. And since life in the voice springs from emotion, drab and uninspiring technical exercises can never be sufficient. Cicely Berry never departs from the fundamental recognition that speaking is part of a whole: an expression of inner life.. After a voice session with her I have known actors speak not of the voice but of a growth in human relationships. This is a high tribute to work that is the opposite of specialization. Cicely Berry sees the voice teacher as involved in all of a theatre&#39;s work. She would never try to separate the sound of words from their living context. For her the two are inseparable. --from Peter Brook&#39;s foreword to Voice and the Actor</p><p><p><b>Cicely Frances Berry</b> CBE was a British theatre director and vocal coach.

On the Galapagos Islands, curious visitors want to see with their own eyes the exotic, unique, tame wildlife that stimulated Charles Darwin to formulate the theory of evolution. In this book is all the information you need to find, identify, and learn about Ecuador's magnificent animal life. The authors, professional biologists, selected for color illustrations more than 500 of Ecuador's most common insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals -- the species you are most likely to see. In one easy-to-carry, entertainingly written, beautifully illustrated book, you will have as constant companion on your journey: <p>- Identifying and location information on the most frequently spotted animals - Up-to-date information on the ecology, behavior, and conservation of the families of animals to which the pictured species belong - Information on Ecuador's habitats and on the most common plants you will encounter - Brief descriptions of the region's most frequently visited parks and reserves.</p></p><p>Even though I'm a professional wildlife biologist, I've always found it difficult while travelling to identify animals I'm not familiar with and to get good, on-site information about them, unless I'm with an expert guide or willing to lug around several heavy books (a bird book, a mammal book, etc.). I've produced the Ecotravellers' Wildlife Guides to help solve this problem. The books in the series are aimed at travellers with an interest in animals, at people for whom some of the best moments of any trip to places like southern Mexico are unexpected encounters with birds and mammals, reptiles and amphibians, fish and other marine organisms. You will find in these books information on <br> (1) common animals likely to be seen,<br> (2) those that are commonly pointed out by tour-guides and tourist literature,<br> (3) some threatened ones that are, for example, subjects of conservation attention, and <br> (4) some that are of special ecological significance. <p>The books, endorsed by the Wildlife Conservation Society, are real field guides, with extensive color artwork produced by some of the world's top wildlife artists. To give you an idea of the "depth" of coverage, the Tropical Mexico book (which covers the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun region, Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Tabasco states) includes detailed information and color illustrations on 104 plates of about 250 bird species, 55 mammals, 95 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 150 coral reef fish and other marine organisms - the book truly covers most of the animals you might encounter in this large region. Additionally, initial chapters in each book introduce the country or region, its habitats and climate, its common trees and other plants, and describe conservation projects and ecotourism there, as well as major eco-attractions (national parks, nature reserves, etc.). My hopes are that these books will be put to good use in the field by ecotravellers, will make trips more enjoyable, and will assist in conservation in a small way by helping to educate people about the wildlife and habitats in the countries through which they travel.</p>David L.

It can no longer be separated from society. Everything is a blur of hybrids, where humans possess no exceptional agency to set them apart from dead matter. But is it really so? In this blistering polemic and theoretical manifesto, Andreas Malm develops a counterargument: in a warming world, nature comes roaring back, and it is more important than ever to distinguish between the natural and the social. Only with a unique agency attributed to humans can resistance become conceivable.</p><p><b>Andreas Malm</b> teaches human ecology at Lund University, Sweden. He is the author, with Shora Esmailian, of <i>Iran on the Brink: Rising Workers and Threats of War</i>, and of <i>Fossil Capital</i>, which won the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial Prize.&#x201c;Andreas Malm&#x2019;s new masterpiece <i>The Progress of This Storm</i> fills an urgent need, as did his seminal <i>Fossil Capital</i> in 2016. In his earlier book, he demonstrated that the fossil capitalism was not preordained by God or Nature or Technology, and that the answer is system change not climate change. In his new study, he teaches us how we can transcend those fashionable, ecological philosophies, clouding our understanding, that stand in the way of the unity of environmental theory and practice. No more definitive work of its kind exists today.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;John Bellamy Foster, editor of <i>Monthly Review</i>, author of <i>Marx&#x2019;s Ecology</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;As the global crisis grows, it is more important than ever to understand the complex relationship between society and nature, but much of what passes for environmental theory generates more confusion than insight. Andreas Malm has written another essential contribution to ecological Marxism, a brilliant and clearly written polemic that demolishes constructionism, hybridism, postmodernism and related academic fads, and defends historical materialism as the only credible alternative.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Ian Angus, author of <i>Facing the Anthropocene</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Progress of This Storm</i> is a furious defense of dialectical thought, and of historical materialism as the theoretical lens appropriate for viewing global warming in all its social and natural complexity.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Michael Robbins,<i>Bookforum</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Progress of This Storm</i> issues a welcome call to get serious about political agency.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Alyssa Battistoni, <i>Nation</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;Andreas Malm has a deep understanding of climate change, writes clearly, and presents a useful overview of environmental thought.

It is a concept with multiple and contested meanings. Prefix it with the word &#x2018;western&#x2019; and you have a whole new set of problems. Equally thorny is the belief, once commonplace, that civilisation was a singular project, a phenomenon that spread across parts of the world from a single source. The view that multiple civilisations emerged independently at various times and in various places across the world was not an idea many Victorian thinkers had much time for. Indeed, in the age of European Empires, nations justified their domination of other peoples by claiming they were engaged in a great &#x2018;civilising mission&#x2019;. Perhaps all that is certain about the concept of civilisation is that its opposite, barbarism, is toxic. In Civilisations, David Olusoga travels the world to piece together the shared histories that link nations.<br><br>In Part One, First Contact, we discover what happened to art in the great Age of Discovery, when civilisations encountered each other for the first time? Although undoubtedly a period of conquest and destruction it was also one of mutual curiosity, global trade and the exchange of ideas <br><br>In Part Two, The Cult of Progress we see how the Industrial Revolution transformed the world, impacting every corner, and every civilisation, from the cotton mills of the Midlands, through Napoleon&#x2019;s conquest of Egypt, to the demise of both Native American and Maori populations and the advent of photography in Paris in 1839.<br><br>Incredible art &#x2013; both looted and created &#x2013; relay the key events and their outcomes throughout the world.</p><p>David Olusoga is an Anglo-Nigerian historian and producer.

Written in Pali, the language of the Theravada Buddhist canon, the Jatakas comprise one of the largest and oldest collections of stories in the world dating from the fifth century BCE to the third century CE. Generations in South and South-East Asia have grown up with these tales. This volume contains twenty-six stories drawn from various ancient sources, and each story reflects one of the ten perfections giving, restraint, renunciation, wisdom, strength, acceptance, truthfulness, resolve, loving kindness and equanimity. A detailed introduction elaborates on the ten perfections, explains the forms of enlightenment as well as the structure, and the historical and geographical contexts of the stories. Sarah Shaw brings to life the teachings of Buddhism for the scholar and lay reader alike.</p><p></p><h2>History of the Thirteen (The Human Comedy)</h2><p>Passionate and perceptive, the three short novels that make up Balzac's History of the Thirteen are concerned in part with the activities of a rich, powerful, sinister and unscrupulous secret society in nineteenth-century France. While the deeds of 'The Thirteen' remain frequently in the background, however, the individual novels are concerned with exploring various forms of desire. A tragic love story, Ferragus depicts a marriage destroyed by suspicion, revelation and misunderstanding. The Duchess de Langeais explores the anguish that results when a society coquette tries to seduce a heroic ex-soldier, while The Girl with the Golden Eyes offers a frank consideration of desire and sexuality.

After attending boarding school in Vend�me, he gravitated to Paris where he worked as a legal clerk and a hack writer, using various pseudonyms, often in collaboration with other writers. Balzac turned exclusively to fiction at the age of thirty and went on to write a large number of novels and short stories set amid turbulent nineteenth-century France. He entitled his collective works The Human Comedy. Along with Victor Hugo and Dumas p�re and fils, Balzac was one of the pillars of French romantic literature. He died in 1850, shortly after his marriage to the Polish countess Evelina Hanska, his lover of eighteen years.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Art of Loving God: Simple Virtues for the Christian Life</h2><p><p>There are as many paths to holiness as there are saints in Heaven . . . but you cant follow them all. Yet there's one thing every saint practices that you can imitate: the simple art of loving God, which the beloved St. Francis de Sales explains for you here.</p> <p>Under his wise and gentle guidance, you'll discover the secrets to growing holier through the simple things in life work, play, and rest. You'll learn to avoid the distractions (even religious distractions) that trouble and weary your soul . . . and you'll soon be able to focus your energy simply on loving God.</p> <p>Listen to the holy words of this saint; take them to heart; make them a part of your life. Soon you'll be well on your way, following that path to Heaven that God, from all eternity, has given you as your very own.</p> <p>St. Francis de Sales himself will teach you the secrets of developing:</p> <li>Patience</li><li>Trust </li><li>Modesty</li><li>Courage </li><li>Simplicity</li><li>Humility</li><li>Obedience</li><li>Generosity</li><li>Perseverance</li><li>Selflessness</li><li>Gentleness </li><li>Love of God and other key virtues <br><br> <p>A note for the skeptical and discouraged:</p> <p>Have you tried to grow closer to God using one technique after another, yet still find you haven't made much progress? That's a common problem in today's world, where devotion has become so complicated that the simple art of loving God has been lost.</p> <p>Don't despair. Generations of Christians have made finding God harder than it need be, which is why, every few hundred years, God sends us a saint like St. Francis de Sales to remind us that anyone can love God and that it's not really so hard to do. Listen to St. Francis, and, no matter how many times you've failed in the past, you'll soon be a master of the art of loving God.</p></li></p><p>St. Francis de Sales (1567-1622), bishop, Doctor of the Church, and patron of writers, was ordained a priest in 1593.

The twenty-one-year-old Swedish model told the magazine she&#x2019;d left her native Stockholm for Chicago because she&#x2019;d been swept up in &#x201c;America Fever.&#x201d; In November 1972, <i>Playboy </i>returned her en- thusiasm by featuring her, under the name Lenna Sj��blom, in its signature spread. If S�derberg had followed the path of her predeces- sors, her image would have been briefly famous, then relegated to gathering dust under the beds of teenage boys. But one particular photo of Lena S�derberg would not fade into obscurity. Instead, her face would become as famous and recognizable as Mona Lisa&#x2019;s&#x2014;not to most Americans, but to everyone studying computer science for the next half a century.<br><br> In engineering circles, some refer to Lena as the first lady of the internet. But others call her the industry&#x2019;s original sin, the first step in Silicon Valley&#x2019;s exclusion of women. Both views stem from an event that took place back in 1973 at a University of Southern California computer lab, where a team of researchers, led by William Pratt, PhD, was trying to turn physical photographs into digital bits. The work would pave the way for the development of the JPEG, a compression scheme that allows large image files to be efficiently trans- ferred between devices. But the JPEG was far into the future. In 1973, researchers needed to test their algorithms on suitable pho- tos&#x2014;pictures full of detail and texture. And their search for the ideal test photo led them to Lena. <br><br>Until now, the role of Dr. William Pratt in the choice of Lena&#x2019;s photo has been completely unknown. I tracked Pratt down thanks to a passing lead on an old message board. He had left USC to take a job at Sun Microsystems and was working pro bono at Stanford Hospital, scouring MRIs and CT scans.<br><br> In a telephone interview, Pratt explained how he and his team had just received a large grant from ARPA (today known as DARPA), a Department of Defense agency that would lay the groundwork for the invention of the internet. The grad students were gathering pho- tos that would provide good test subjects for their algorithms. Con- veniently, a student had recently brought in a copy of the previous November&#x2019;s <i>Playboy</i>. &#x201c;I think they were enjoying the magazine, and it just happened to be there,&#x201d; Pratt told me. When I asked if he or any of the grad students had been concerned that using <i>Playboy </i>pho- tos for their research might offend anyone, he said that issue simply didn&#x2019;t come up.<br><br> Pratt&#x2019;s team flipped through the glossy magazine looking for usable images. &#x201c;I said, &#x2018;There are some pretty nice-looking pictures in there,&#x2019;&#x201d; he remembered, &#x201c;and the grad students picked the one that was in the centerfold.&#x201d; The full three-page spread of Lena, wearing boots, a boa, and a floppy, feathered hat, shows her bare backside and one exposed breast. But because the 1970s-era scanners they were exper- imenting with were much smaller than current models, the chosen photo was cropped into a relatively chaste square in which Lena looks suggestively over her bare shoulder.<br><br> From a technical standpoint, Pratt told me, Lena&#x2019;s photo was ideal because all the different colors and textures made it a challenge to&nbsp;process. &#x201c;She is wearing a hat with a big feather on it with lots of high-frequency detail that is difficult to code,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Over the next several years, Pratt&#x2019;s team developed a whole library of digital images not from <i>Playboy</i>. The original data set included photos of a brightly colored mandrill, a rainbow of bell peppers, and several photos of other fully clothed women simply titled &#x201c;Girl.&#x201d; Scanners were relatively rare at that time, so they made some of this library available for other imaging scientists to test their algorithms. &#x201c;One of the things you want to do is compare your work to others in the field,&#x201d; Pratt said, &#x201c;and in order to do that, you have to start with the same original. Each of us tried to code algorithms better than our neighbors.&#x201d;<br><br> All of these photos, including Lena&#x2019;s, are still available to download for free from the USC website, but for decades Lena&#x2019;s has been by far the most popular. Her image has been displayed in countless projects, slide-show presentations, journals, books, and conference papers. She has served as a test subject for myriad editing techniques, including color correction and auto-focus. New research featuring her picture is published monthly.<br><br> <i>Playboy, </i>notoriously vigilant about copyright infringement, decided to let the burgeoning image-processing industry make Lena its go-to. Company executives saw the photo&#x2019;s ubiquity as free publicity rather than the precursor of an internet sex industry that would profoundly disrupt the soft-porn magazine business. In a 2013 article, <i>Playboy </i>highlighted an industry newsletter&#x2019;s assertion that Lena was, to early computer scientists, what Rita Hayworth was to World War II sol- diers: the top pinup girl of the era.<br><br> For fifty years, this woman&#x2019;s face and bare shoulder have served as a benchmark for image-processing quality, from the teams working on Apple&#x2019;s iPhone camera to Google Images. Engineers joke that if you want your algorithm to perform well, it better perform well on Lena. Some know her photo so intimately that with little more than a glance they can easily evaluate any image algorithm run on her.<br><br>MEETING LENA&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Deanna Needell remembers the moment when she first saw Lena in a textbook during one of her computer science classes at the University of Nevada, Reno. &#x201c;Some of the boys were giggling and I remember thinking, &#x2018;What are they giggling about?&#x2019; And they were looking at her picture,&#x201d; Needell recalls. Shortly afterward, she learned that the smiling woman was in fact fully nude. &#x201c;It made me realize, &#x2018;Oh, I am the only woman. I am different.&#x2019; It made gender an issue for me where it wasn&#x2019;t before.&#x201d; Another female engineer told me that, as a young computer science student, she thought Lena was just a pretty face, until she saw the full centerfold taped onto the door of a male classmate&#x2019;s dorm room. Needell, who went on to become valedictorian of her college class and a mathematics professor at UCLA, strongly believes Lena&#x2019;s photo is one reason women have been left behind in technology. In 2013, she took a stand that has evolved into somewhat of a campaign to rid the industry of the image for good. Needell&#x2019;s humorous starting point was this: in an otherwise serious paper about a particular image- processing technique, she and her co-author Rachel Ward tested an image of the Italian male model Fabio. &#x201c;We contacted Fabio&#x2019;s agent . . . and apparently Fabio was thrilled,&#x201d; Needell recalls. She chose an im- age that, like Lena&#x2019;s, featured a variety of detail and textures, from Fabio&#x2019;s long blond hair to bricks in the background. The paper was published in the <i>SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences</i>. If the men didn&#x2019;t seem to mind subjecting women in the field to overly idealized images<br> of women, she&#x2019;d simply do the same in reverse.<br><br> Needell didn&#x2019;t leave it at that. While giving talks about her work, she would throw Fabio&#x2019;s photo into the slide show, which usually elicited light chuckles from the audience. Other researchers started emailing her to ask if they too could use the image. Needell would share the photo with Fabio&#x2019;s permission. &#x201c;It definitely got people talking,&#x201d; Needell says. &#x201c;It got a conversation started which hadn&#x2019;t been started.&#x201d; <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br> Needell is certain that many other women in the field have reacted to Lena&#x2019;s image the same way she did. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever talked to a woman who says, &#x2018;Oh yeah, we should keep Lena,&#x2019;&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now when that picture of Lena comes up, heads turn toward my direction. It&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;m going to jump up and scream about, but I just kind of roll my eyes.&#x201d;<br> In the mid-1990s, the editor of one trade journal, David Munson, received many requests asking him to ban Lena&#x2019;s image from the pub- lication. Instead, he wrote an editorial encouraging engineers to use other images. Another industry leader, Jeff Seideman, however, cam- paigned to keep Lena in circulation, arguing that, far from being sex- ist, the image memorialized one of the most important events in the history of electronic imaging. &#x201c;When you use a picture like that for so long, it&#x2019;s not a person anymore; it&#x2019;s just pixels,&#x201d; Seideman told the <i>Atlantic </i>in 2016, unwittingly highlighting the problem Needell and others were trying to point out. The dehumanization of women through digitized and overly sexualized images that could fly across computer networks was the danger.<br><br> When I asked Pratt why he had never shared his role in Lena&#x2019;s story, he told me I was the first reporter to ask him about it. He seemed nonplussed when I pressed him about the controversy that still surrounds the choice of this test photo. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t paid attention to [the controversy] at all,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t make any sense to me . . . We didn&#x2019;t even think about those things at all when we were doing this. It was just natural that we would use a good-quality image, and some of the best images were in <i>Playboy</i>. It was not sexist.&#x201d;<br> Besides, no one could have been offended, he told me, because there were no women in the classroom at the time.<br><br> As an isolated incident, the lab&#x2019;s use of a <i>Playboy </i>centerfold is not especially upsetting. There was no nudity in the cropped version re- searchers used&#x2014;just a pretty face, a bare shoulder, and a silly hat. Pratt&#x2019;s students were guilty of, at worst, an ignorant and juvenile de- cision. However, more than four decades after its initial selection, the&nbsp;prolific use of Lena&#x2019;s photo can be seen as a harbinger of behavior within the tech industry that is far less innocent. In Silicon Valley today, women are second-class citizens and most men are blind to it. The tragedy is, it didn&#x2019;t have to be this way. The exclusion of women from this critical industry was not inevitable. In many ways, the in- dustry sabotaged itself and its own pipeline of bright female talent. <br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> While there might have been no women in Pratt&#x2019;s lab on the day Lena&#x2019;s image was chosen, what many don&#x2019;t realize is that women played crucial roles in the burgeoning technology industry. In the 1840s, a woman and brilliant mathematician named Ada Lovelace wrote the first program for a computer that had yet to be built. A century later, women were among the pioneers who worked on the first computing devices for the military during World War II. Women were marginalized once peace was restored. After that setback, how- ever, the percentage of computer science bachelor&#x2019;s degrees awarded to women steadily increased. For a time, women were charging into the field at about the same rate they were moving into other tradition- ally male realms, including medicine and the law.<br><br> Women and men reached parity on college campuses in the United States in 1980, and today more women than men graduate from col- lege. Starting in 1970, the number of women in schools of law and medicine steadily increased, until eventually men and women began to graduate from both in equal numbers. In 1984, the year the Mac- intosh was unveiled, women in tech reached a high point, receiving almost 40 percent of computer science degrees. Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s when women&#x2019;s progress in tech suddenly stalled.<br> By that time, women were entering the workforce in droves, and the growing tech industry could have drawn on that influx of smart and ambitious women to staff its expansion. Just as computers began to head into the mainstream, however, women&#x2019;s participation in the field started to plummet. Today women earn just 22 percent of computer science degrees, a number that has remained basically flat for a decade. The tech industry&#x2014;taking root in the heart of the left-leaning West Coast&#x2014;might have become a beacon of inclusion and diversity. To say that it did not is a grand understatement.<br>According to recent data, women hold a mere quarter of computing jobs in the United States, down from 36 percent in 1991. The num- bers are actually worse at big companies such as Google and Facebook. In 2017, women at Google accounted for 31 percent of jobs overall and only 20 percent of vital technical roles. At Facebook, women make up 35 percent of the total workforce and 19 percent of technical jobs. The statistics are downright depressing for women of color: black women hold 3 percent of computing jobs, and Latina women hold 1 percent. Additionally, this small percentage of women employed in the field don&#x2019;t necessarily stick with it; women are leaving jobs in technol- ogy and engineering more than twice as fast as their male peers.<br> When it comes to tech start-up entrepreneurs, the minor royalty of Silicon Valley, the disparity is even starker. In the larger American workforce, women make up almost half of all employees and are ma- jority owners of nearly 40 percent of businesses. But women-led com- panies received only 2 percent of venture funding in 2016. The vast majority of venture capitalists (VCs) are men, and they largely invest their capital in companies run by men. Women accounted for only 7 percent of VC partners at top funds in 2016. Of nearly seven thou- sand VC-backed companies surveyed in a study at Babson College, just 2.7 percent of them had a female CEO. All this despite research that shows women-led companies outperform their peers.<br><br> I wrote this book to ask&#x2014;and answer&#x2014;several important questions: What went wrong? How did women get pushed to the side- lines? And what can be done? Go to any Silicon Valley conference or cocktail party and you&#x2019;ll hear people earnestly asking similar ques- tions. You&#x2019;ll also hear the standard answers, given so often they can now be delivered in code words such as &#x201c;meritocracy.&#x201d; That term implies both that a level playing field exists and that men deserve their&nbsp;prominence because they have outcompeted women or possess a special type of intelligence. You also might hear that it&#x2019;s a &#x201c;pipeline prob- lem,&#x201d; a &#x201c;leaky bucket problem,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;women just don&#x2019;t like nerds&#x201d; problem. The blame is shifted to society, schools, parents, or girls and women themselves. All of these offhand answers&#x2014;and the myths and half-truths they contain&#x2014;need to be taken apart and closely exam- ined, not just because technology is a critical slice of our modern economy, but also because of the preeminent role the Valley plays in shaping the future of humanity. <br><br> &#x201c;When you write a line of code, you can affect a lot of people,&#x201d; Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook&#x2019;s COO, told me as we sat in her so-called Only Good News conference room at the social network&#x2019;s headquar- ters in Menlo Park, California. &#x201c;It matters that there aren&#x2019;t enough women in computer science. It matters that there aren&#x2019;t enough women in engineering. It matters that there aren&#x2019;t enough women CEOs. It matters that there aren&#x2019;t enough women VCs. It matters that there isn&#x2019;t enough of a track record of entrepreneurs to fund,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Everyone is looking for the next Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg. There&#x2019;s pattern matching that goes on there, and they don&#x2019;t look like you and they don&#x2019;t look like me.&#x201d;<br><br> The a...</p><h2>The New Short Story Theories</h2><p><p>The first edition of May&#x2019;s <i>Short Story Theories</i> (1976) opened with an essay entitled &#x201c;The Short Story: An Underrated Art.&#x201d; Almost two decades later, the short story suffers no such slight.

The founder of <em>Adbusters</em> magazine, Lasn aims to stop the branding of America by changing the way information flows; the way institutions wield power; the way television stations are run; and the way the food, fashion, automobile, sports, music, and culture industries set agendas. With a courageous and compelling voice, Lasn deconstructs the advertising culture and our fixation on icons and brand names. And he shows how to organize resistance against the power trust that manages the brands by "uncooling" consumer items, by "dermarketing" fashions and celebrities, and by breaking the "media trance" of our TV-addicted age.</p><p>A powerful manifesto by a leading media activist, <em>Culture Jam</em> lays the foundations for the most significant social movement of the early twenty-first century -- a movement that can change the world and the way we think and live.</p></p><p>Featured in the PBS documentary <em>Affluenza,</em> Kalle Lasn, whose documentaries have been broadcast on PBS, CBC, and around the world, has won 15 international awards, and has been profiled in <em>Time.</em> As publisher of <em>Adbusters</em> magazine and founder of Media Foundation and Powershift Advertising Agency, Lasn has launched social marketing campaigns like Buy Nothing Day and TV Turnoff Week.

Exciting Fantasy Adventure by the <i>New York Times</i> Best-Selling Author of the Honor Harrington Series. First Time in Paperback.<br><br>In The War God's Own, Bahzell had managed to stop a war by convincing Baron Tellian, leader of the Sothoii, to "surrender" to him, the War God's champion. Now, he has journeyed to the Sothoii Wind Plain to oversee the parole he granted to Tellian and his men, to represent the Order of Tomanak, the War God, and to be an ambassador for the hradani. What's more, the flying coursers of the Sothoii have accepted Bahzell as a wind rider-the first hradani wind rider in history. And since the wind riders are the elite of the elite among the Sothoii, Bahzell's ascension is as likely to stir resentment as respect. That combination of duties would have been enough to keep anyone busy-even a warrior prince like Bahzell-but additional complications are bubbling under the surface. The goddess Shigu, the Queen of Hell, is sowing dissension among the war maids of the Sothoii. The supporters of the deposed Sothoii noble who started the war are plotting to murder their new leige lord and frame Bahzell for the deed. Of course, those problems are all in a day's work for a champion of the War God. But what is Bahzell going to do about the fact that Baron Tellian's daughter, and heir to the realm, seems to be thinking that he is the only man-or hradani-for her?</p><p><b>David Weber</b> is the science fiction phenomenon of the decade.

To endure unnecessary prolonged pain and suffering, and merely to exist in a state of total indignity and dependency such as in Alzheimer's dementia. Uninformed, some people add layers of tragedy to their destiny. Some choose to die prematurely; others, violently; a few risk imprisonment by mercy killing. Often their lament is, If only Physician-Assisted Suicide were legal. Yet there is an alternative that is already legal: Voluntary Refusal of Food &amp; Fluid. While sometimes intentionally maligned as barbaric starvation, ceasing all Food &amp; Fluid is a truly peaceful way to hasten dying by dehydration. While taking an average of 14 days, it allows for the exchange of healing goodbyes with loved ones who can forever be sure it was these patients' intent since they could have changed their mind. <br>What makes the process peaceful? Knowing how to control thirst. (The author went on two fasts himself to learn what works.) In addition, good discussions with family members before beginning. Consistent with the principles of some religions, this method is available even for patients who are physically too sick to put a lethal dose of medication in their mouths and swallow. <br>By creating strategically effective documents for a trusted agent or proxy to withhold Food &amp; Fluid on the patient's behalf, this way to <i>Permit Natural Dying</i> can actually extend the quality of life of those with early dementia. They can enjoy living until they reach a point they have previously described in behavioral terms (perhaps with help from using one of the book's forms). <br>Beyond serving as an authoritative source of information to strive for an ironclad strategy for dementia, the book endorses life's most ironic fact: When people know they can control when they die--they can, and often do--choose to live longer. <br> Poignant memoirs illustrate its practical guidelines and useful forms; for example, why Proxy Directives are more effective than Living Wills, and how to make Living Wills work better if they are the only available choice. <br>The book-within-a-book format of this book is as unique as its content is comprehensive. Over 300 citations, an index, a glossary, and further resources... yet its core reading is user-friendly for all.

Terman is a board-certified psychiatrist who has dedicated nearly three decades of his professional life to relationship issues and end-of-life challenges. His degrees are B.A. (Brown University); Ph.D. (M.I.T.), M.D. (U. Iowa). Formerly on the faculty of the University of California, Irvine, he founded the nonprofit organization Caring Advocates whose team of clinical, legal, and spiritual professionals helps patients and their families attain the goal of peaceful transitions. <br>In working with terminally ill patients and their loved ones, Dr. Terman regularly assesses the judgment and ability to make decisions of patients who wish to create strategic Living Wills and Powers of Attorney for medical or financial decisions. He also provides advice and support for individuals designated as Proxies when they are faced with the awesome responsibility to make an end-of-life decision for another. <br>Having participated actively in three bioethics committees and consulted at the San Diego Hospice, Dr. Terman now lectures to professional and general audiences. A sample of topics from this book includes: "Moral Paternalism and The President s Council on Bioethics," "The Sanctity of Many Lives," and, "Does Hollywood Accurately Portray Alzheimer s disease?" <br>Dr. Terman believes educating people on the legal, peaceful choice to refuse food and fluid has potential to help far more people than expensive political campaigns to attempt to legalize Physician-Assisted Dying, which cannot help millions of people avoid their greatest fear: progressive indignity and dependency from such devastating diseases as Alzheimer's. <br>Attorneys for Terri Schiavo s parents submitted Dr. Terman's declaration to Florida's Judge George Greer. Dr. Terman agreed to participate in the spirit of two beliefs he holds most dear: "We are morally obligated to honor a patient s previously expressed wishes," and, "We should do everything possible to learn directly from the patient, what she or he wants." <br>Dr. Terman is currently creating a series of books, audio CDs, and DVDs in the series, The <i>BEST WAY</i> to Attain Peaceful Transitions. He is also the author of Lethal Choice, a medical thriller based on a conspiracy theory of Physician-Assisted Suicide that explores end-of-life ethical principles.

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous "White City" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. <i>--John Moe</i>Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century.

I can tell you it&#x2019;s been in my family for generations. That after all these years it&#x2019;s still beautiful. And what happened the day I wore it wasn&#x2019;t the dress&#x2019;s fault.</p><p>It was designed and created for my great-grandmother&#x2019;s cousin&nbsp; Lindy&#x2019;s wedding. She was the only one of my grandmother&#x2019;s female relatives whose family came through the Crash with most of their money still intact. At the time it was made THE DRESS, which is how we refer to it, cost more than your average house, a flagrant extravagance at a time when so many had no homes, or jobs, or even food to eat.</p><p>It&#x2019;s one of a kind. Ivory satin with a scooped neck, flange collar, and a cleverly fitted bodice. Long fitted sleeves narrow down to a gentle point just beyond the wrist. A creamy waterfall of satin cascades toward the floor and swirls around the ankles, rounds into a train. It&#x2019;s clean lined and elegant. No cutouts. No jewels. Its stark simplicity takes the breath away. With its Chantilly lace mantilla it&#x2019;s the kind of dress meant for a showy, yet tasteful, fairy-tale wedding to a handsome prince. And while happily ever after is never guaranteed, it&#x2019;s implied.</p><p>After Lindy, my grandmother and her other cousins wore it. So did their daughters and those of us who followed. Somehow it flatters any figure. A satin version of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants long before it was written. In fact, I bet if you subtracted the alterations that were sometimes required and divided its cost by the number of family brides who&#x2019;ve worn it, THE DRESS was probably a bargain.</p><p>Every single Jameson bride looked beautiful in it. I know because I studied the family wedding albums a million times when I was a girl in Richmond and imagined myself wearing it.</p><p>The portrait of my mother in the gown hung above my parents&#x2019; bed until the day she died. It was part of the room. A touchstone. A reminder that even plain women are beautiful on their wedding day. When reality is suspended and everything, especially happiness, seems possible. When no one is thinking about what it will feel like to deal with sickness rather than health. Or anticipating the till-death-do-us-part part.</p><p>The dress fit me perfectly. A fact I interpreted as confirmation that my marriage was meant to be. That Jake was my destiny.</p><p>Try as I might to forget I still remember every detail of my wedding day. Sipping from a flute of champagne with my bridesmaids at our house on Monument Avenue while we had our hair and makeup done. The way my hands shook when I was helped into THE DRESS. How fast my heart beat on the way to the church. The way my pulse skittered while the 150 guests were escorted to their seats as the string ensemble played.</p><p>I walked down the aisle barely feeling my father&#x2019;s arm under my hand or the floor beneath my kitten heels. All eyes were on me. In the most beautiful dress ever.</p><p>I smiled at Jake. Saw the love in his warm brown eyes. Let him take my hand. He squeezed it as we turned to face the minister.</p><p>And then, although I&#x2019;ve been replaying it in my mind for over forty years now, I don&#x2019;t really understand what happened. It was as if everything I&#x2019;d thought, everything I&#x2019;d felt, flew out of my head. When Reverend Frailey cleared his voice and said, &#x201c;Dearly beloved,&#x201d; I was struck with a thunderbolt of clarity, or perhaps it was a thunderbolt of panic, that felt as if it had been delivered directly from above. (And I don&#x2019;t mean the choir loft.)</p><p>Suddenly I realized that I might be making a mistake. That I&#x2019;d only just turned twenty-one. That it was 1978 and I was woman, but I had not yet even attempted to roar. That I might not actually be ready to start the family Jake wanted so badly or even commit the rest of my life to another person. Not even Jake.</p><p>Like I said, it wasn&#x2019;t THE DRESS&#x2019;s fault. And it definitely wasn&#x2019;t Jake&#x2019;s.</p><p>Three months later when the presents had all finally been returned and I discovered that I was pregnant with his child, his family wasn&#x2019;t speaking to mine and I&#x2019;d already done far too much damage to tell him. Until then I hadn&#x2019;t realized that God was into irony. I mean what kind of deity would smite you with a fear of commitment at the worst possible moment and then make you a single mother, arguably the largest commitment ever?</p><p>So there it is. A slight wrinkle in THE DRESS&#x2019;s mostly unblemished history.</p><p>I&#x2019;m hoping my daughter will have a happier ending in THE DRESS. If, in fact, she ever wears it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b><br></b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE</p><p>Lauren</p><p>Three days to forty</p><p>New York City</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God. You&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#x2019;re Lauren James.&#x201d; The woman looks down at the book on her lap then back up at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m reading Rip Tide right now. I&#x2019;ve read everything you&#x2019;ve ever written. Every single word.&#x201d; She looks so genuinely excited. As if it&#x2019;s Christmas morning and she found me under the tree and can&#x2019;t wait to unwrap me. If her feet weren&#x2019;t currently soaking in warm soapy water she would be moving toward me, holding out the hardcover of my latest novel in her lap for my signature. &#x201c;I just love your books. I buy them in print and digital. I listen to them on audio while I work out.&#x201d;</p><p>As other women look up, I thank my lucky stars that I put on makeup and washed my hair today. Writing is not the glamorous profession people think it is. In fact, authors spend long periods of time alone, unwashed, and on deadline. Grooming and hygiene can take a distant second to word count.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, so you&#x2019;re the one keeping me in print.&#x201d; My smile is real and so is my gratitude. No matter how many times you hear that someone loves what you&#x2019;ve written, it feels good. It&#x2019;s like being told that your children are talented and beautiful. Or at least I assume that&#x2019;s what it feels like since I&#x2019;ve never given birth. The thing is, if you don&#x2019;t have enough readers who love what you do no one will pay you to do it anymore.</p><p>She laughs at the very idea of being my only fan, because I&#x2019;ve been successfully published for over a decade and hit the New York Times bestseller list on a satisfyingly consistent basis. In fact, I&#x2019;ve been dubbed the &#x201c;Queen of Beach Reads.&#x201d; Which means I write the kind of books that those who want to appear literary like to sneer at, but that sell hundreds of thousands of copies. And allow me to own an apartment in a really great building on Central Park West.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;m so glad you enjoy my books.&#x201d; I shoot the woman a last smile then turn my attention to my manicurist, Hanh. After a few words of greeting and a couple of polite questions about her children, which is about all we manage given my lack of Vietnamese and her gaps in English, I settle back into the big leather seat. I close my eyes and try to focus on the warm water swirling around my feet, but I&#x2019;m careful to keep a pleasant smile on my lips so that none of the women who are currently Googling me can interpret my silence as diva-ish or carry tales about how rude and unappreciative I am.</p><p>My breathing evens out as Hanh&#x2019;s small, competent hands massage my feet. I attempt to visualize a bright-blue sky with puffy white clouds floating through it. Like the ones that used to form over the Atlantic Ocean in the Outer Banks, where I grew up.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not very good at meditation and although it&#x2019;s not supposed to be possible, I failed yoga. My brain refuses to slow down or follow instructions and no matter how hard I try to shut down, I&#x2019;m inevitably thinking about all the things I&#x2019;m thinking about but shouldn&#x2019;t be. Then I think about not thinking.</p><p>At the moment, all I can think about is that I&#x2019;m going to be forty in two days, twenty-two hours, and thirty-five minutes whether I&#x2019;m ready or not. Then I think about how old that is. How not like my body my body has become. Hanh lifts one foot out of the water and I think about how unattractive my toes are.</p><p>I take a conscious breath, counting slowly to seven then holding it before I exhale to a count of ten. This is supposed to clear your mind and help you turn your thoughts in a more pleasant, affirmative direction. I&#x2019;m not any better at this than I am at not thinking, but I finally manage to pull up an image of Spencer, the man I&#x2019;ve been dating for almost a year now, three months longer than I&#x2019;ve dated anyone since I came to New York. He&#x2019;s a successful playwright and songwriter with a string of hit Broadway musicals to his credit. He understands what being on deadline means and he&#x2019;s every bit as driven as I am, only way better at disguising it.</p><p>I let myself try to imagine the surprise birthday dinner he&#x2019;s planning. I inhale again, even more slowly this time. I&#x2019;ve spent more than a few birthdays alone since I arrived here just after my twenty-first and am beyond glad to have someone to face down forty with.</p><p>I was supposed to come to New York with Brianna, my best friend in the world; a friend who felt more like a sister from the day we met in kindergarten and discovered we were born on the same day. (We were both wearing paper crowns at the time.)</p><p>We practically lived in each other&#x2019;s houses while we were growing up. When we were in high school her grandmother died and her archaeologist parents went on yet another dig on yet another continent and never really came back and she moved in with us.</p><p>Bree and I inhaled books and dreamed of being writers. We wrote our first illustrated fairy tale together in second grade and turned it into a graphic romance novel when we were fourteen. We brainstormed and wrote part of a work of historical fiction while we were in high school and plotted out a contemporary novel set on our favorite beach in the Outer Banks in college. We planned to move to New York right after we graduated from college and find an apartment to share, and we were both going to get jobs to support us while we wrote the novel we&#x2019;d plotted.</p><p>Two days before we were supposed to take the bus to New York, Bree pulled out without warning or any real explanation. It was a betrayal of everything we&#x2019;d dreamed and planned our entire lives and all she said was, &#x201c;Sorry, I changed my mind.&#x201d; Like she&#x2019;d decided to order iced tea instead of Coke or thought she&#x2019;d pass on dessert. I didn&#x2019;t know a soul in New York. I climbed onto the bus with wobbly knees, scared to death.</p><p>New York City is intimidating in its own right. Alone and without money it can be hard, cold, and inhospitable. A place to be survived through sheer force of will.</p><p>I was barely hanging on by my fingertips three months later, when I heard that Bree was dating Clay Williams, my boyfriend all through high school and most of college.</p><p>Six months later they were engaged. Even though we were barely speaking I tried to warn her that Clay was nowhere near ready to settle down; something I did out of the remnants of friendship and that she interpreted as jealousy. Then although she&#x2019;s not a blood relative she wore THE DRESS that&#x2019;s been in my family forever. And my mother forced me to be her maid of honor, because of some stupid promise and a pinky swear we made each other in kindergarten.</p><p>If that&#x2019;s not a novel, I don&#x2019;t know what is.</p><p>Bree</p><p>Two days to forty</p><p>Manteo, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;Mary? Are you there?&#x201d; The voice sounds tinny as if it&#x2019;s coming from a great distance, which it pretty much always is. The voice belongs to the woman who gave birth to me. She and my father are somewhere in the Middle East. Or possibly in sub-Saharan Africa. Or maybe the Gal�pagos on some archaeological dig or another.</p><p>I was named after Mary Leakey, the famous fossil hunter whom I&#x2019;ve always hated because my parents clearly loved fossils and hunting for them more than they ever loved me.</p><p>I was five when I stopped answering to Mary and insisted on being called Brianna, which is my middle name. That was when my parents, who&#x2019;d been dragging me from one archaeological dig to another, brought me to live with my grandmother Brianna in her house in Manteo on Roanoke Island so that they could continue to wander. My grandmother died just after my sixteenth birthday, forcing my parents to come back to bury her. They stayed long enough to decide that I was old enough to live on my own in the house she&#x2019;d left me while they finished the dig they&#x2019;d been in the middle of. After that they took turns coming back on occasion though I never sensed any method or thought to their comings and goings. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Kendra and Lauren Jameson marching over and packing up my things and insisting I move in with them, I&#x2019;m not sure what sort of pathetic hermit I might have turned into.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling to wish you a happy birthday. Your father&#x2019;s out of cell phone range but I didn&#x2019;t want to miss this opportunity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, right. Thanks.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s no way of knowing whether she realizes my birthday&#x2019;s not for two days yet. Or the time difference where she is somehow makes up the gap. Or maybe she had the chance to call and realized it was close enough to my birthday to count. I really don&#x2019;t know and every year it matters less. My birth story is a little murky. I&#x2019;ve heard that she was on an island off the coast of California searching for signs of Late Pleistocene Paleocoastal peoples when she went into labor and simply had me there in the sand before going back to work like Russian peasant women used to do back in the day. But instead of tying me in a sling to her bosom she handed me over to an assistant.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have special plans?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you know, the usual.&#x201d; This is a gibe because I can&#x2019;t remember more than a handful of birthdays my biological parents were around for. Which is undoubtedly why I&#x2019;ve made a big fuss and party for each and every one of my children&#x2019;s birthdays, including Lily&#x2019;s sweet sixteen last year.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asks, as if we&#x2019;ve ever had a comfortable conversation since I became aware that I was never even a contender in the competition between my parents&#x2019; love of their work and their love of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m at the store. And I can&#x2019;t really talk right now.&#x201d; This is a lie, but I can&#x2019;t bring myself to come out and tell her that her occasional awkward attempts to communicate just make me feel worse.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s nice.&#x201d; They&#x2019;ve seen my bookstore, Title Waves, a handful of times. The same for their grandchildren.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for the call.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d pace if the store weren&#x2019;t so crowded with bookshelves and display tables. I settle for breathing deeply and telling myself that an unsatisfying phone call is better than no call at all. Then I tell myself that turning forty isn&#x2019;t that big a deal. Ultimately, I do what I always do when I&#x2019;m unhappy. Or nervous. Or angry. I pull my laptop out of my bag, boot it up, and open the manuscript file. I empty my mind and let go of my hurt and irritation as I read the scene I wrote last night when the house was finally quiet and I could sit down in the attic room I&#x2019;ve claimed for my office. It&#x2019;s not as bad as it felt while I was writing it. I read the scene again. Then I begin to cut and paste, which is when I realize what&#x2019;s missing. I lean forward and begin to type. Everything else disappears as a picture of my characters forms in my mind.

He was born in Berkshire in 1926 and he served in the Royal Air Force and the British Army before working as a cameraman for BBC TV. In 2015 he was awarded the CBE for his services to children's literature. He lives in London, not far from Paddington Station. Emily Sutton (Illustrator) Emily Sutton studied illustration at Edinburgh College of Art and has illustrated many picture books including Clara Button, Tiny: The Invisible World of Microbes and The Christmas Eve Tree. She has also created designs for Fortnum &amp; Mason, Bettys Tea Rooms and the Victoria and Albert Museum. She lives and works in York in a house full of doll's houses.&#34;This riches to rags to riches again story is utterly charming. Mr and Mrs Mice and their thirteen children live happily in a dolls&#39; house in a grand castle; apart from having one wall missing, their house is rather grand too, with plenty of room for them all. In Emily Sutton&#39;s gorgeous illustrations their home is full of little details that will fascinate young readers; not since Beatrix Potter either, have mice looked so fine, and yet so very mouse-like, in smart hats and coats. The adventure unfolds perfectly over the length of the book as the mice lose their home, but happily regain it, and there&#39;s a lovely rhythm to the story, told with such apparent ease and so much skill by Michael Bond.

A salient in the German lines, Vitebsk had been declared a Festerplatz&#x2014;a fortress town&#x2014;meaning that it must be held at all costs. A task handed to 3rd Panzer Army in 1943.<br><br>Otto Heidk�mper was chief of staff of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's 3rd Panzer Army, Army Group Center, which was stationed around Vitebsk and Smolensk from early 1942 until June 1944. His detailed account of the defense of Vitebsk through the winter of 1943 into 1944, right up to the Soviet summer offensive, is a valuable firsthand account of how the operations around Vitebsk played out. Twenty maps accompany the narrative. During this time, 3rd Panzer Army undertook numerous military operations to defend the area against the Soviets; they also engaged in anti-partisan operations in the area, deporting civilians accused of supporting partisans and destroying property. <br><br>Finally, in June 1944, the Soviets amassed four armies to take Vitebsk, which was then held by 38,000 men of 53rd Corps. Within three days, Vitebsk was encircled, with 53rd Corps trapped inside. Attempts to break the encirclement failed, and resistance in the pocket broke down over the next few days. On June 27, the final destruction of German resistance in Vitebsk was completed. Twenty thousand Germans were dead and another 10,000 had been captured.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Foreword<br>Maps<br><br>1 The combat situation of the Third Panzer Army in the summer of 1943<br>2 The retreat on the right wing of the Third Panzer Army<br>3 The Soviet penetration at Nevel<br>4 The retreat of the VI Corps to the Panther Line<br>5 Concerns about personnel<br>6 Enemy activity in the Nevel breakthrough area from 18 October 1943<br>7 Commencement of the Soviet offensive east of Vitebsk<br>8 The critical development of the situation on the northern front, and withdrawal combat on the northeastern front<br>9 Further developments on the front to the east of Vitebsk<br>10 Combat and preparations for withdrawal on the northern front of the Third Panzer Army<br>11 Suspected enemy intentions after the frost returned<br>12 The first winter defensive battle around Vitebsk<br>13 Regrouping at the front<br>14 The second winter defensive battle around Vitebsk, and the first signs of the fighting to come<br>15 Regrouping of the Third Panzer Army, and further combat on its right wing<br>16 The removal of units from the Third Panzer Army, and the first discussion of a &#x2018;Vitebsk fortress&#x2019;<br>17 The end of the winter defensive battles, and renewed defensive combat on the Luchesa<br>18 The struggle of the Third Panzer Army against the designation of Vitebsk as a &#x2018;fortress&#x2019;<br>19 Assessment of the situation in the middle of May 1944<br>20 Anti-bandit operations in the rear area of the Panzer Army<br>21 The Soviet summer offensive of 1944: the advance against the Third Panzer Army<br>22 Closing remarks<br><br>Appendix 1: The units under the command of the Third Panzer Army between May 1943 and June 1944<br>Appendix 2: Affi davit on anti-bandit warfare<br>List of Heidk�mper&#x2019;s sources for Vitebsk<br>Index<br></p><p>Otto Heidk�mper was a highly decorated Wehrmacht general who commanded several divisions during World War II.

King returns to Folly Island to deliver her most stunning achievement yet--a breathtaking novel of suspense that explores the very essence of good and evil.<br><br>Allen Carmichael came back from Vietnam a lifetime ago--but only now was he ready to return home. For years, he&#x2019;s lived on the fringes of the law, using a soldier&#x2019;s skills to keep watch over those too young to defend themselves. Some consider him nothing but a kidnapper for hire--the best in the business; others call him a hero. His specialty has been rescuing children from abusive parents and escorting them to loving homes. But after twenty-five years, he is ready to take on his final case--a case that could destroy him. <br><br>The boy&#x2019;s name is Jamie: He believes his father is going to kill him. Allen is convinced that the twelve-year-old is right and devises a strategy to save him. His last job done, Allen heads back to Folly Island, where he plans to settle into a quiet life. But not long after his return, a small plane piloted by the boy&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s crashes, leaving behind debris--but no body. Now it is up to Allen to resolve whether Jamie&#x2019;s father is dead or alive--and to make sure Jamie himself stays out of harm&#x2019;s way. But a series of ominous events leads Allen to question whether Jamie&#x2019;s father is really the enemy after all. Or if the real threat is far more unspeakable...and the killer unimaginable.<br><br>Riveting, harrowing, and unforgettable, <b>Keeping Watch</b> takes psychological suspense to its most dizzying heights and proves again why Laurie R. King has been called by both readers and critics an undisputed master of suspense.</p><p><b>Raves for Laurie R.

It was cold, late autumn, last glowing leaves clinging to the liquidambars and maples his great-grandfather&#x2019;s brother had planted, their surrender close. He loved this time, the morning stillness, loved it more than spring. <br><br>The dogs were tiring now but still hunting the ground, noses down, taking more time to sniff, less hopeful. Then one picked up a scent and, new life in their legs, they loped in file for the trees, vanished. <br><br>When he was near the house, the dogs, black as liquorice, came out of the trees, stopped, heads up, looked around as if seeing the land for the first time. Explorers. They turned their gaze on him for a while, started down the slope.<br><br>He walked the last stretch as briskly as he could and, as he put his hand out to the gate, they reached him. Their curly black heads tried to nudge him aside, insisting on entering first, strong back legs pushing. He unlatched the gate, they pushed it open enough to slip in, nose to tail, trotted down the path to the shed door. Both wanted to be first again, stood with tails up, furry scimitars, noses touching at the door jamb.<br><br>Inside, the big poodles led him to the kitchen. They had water bowls there and they stuck their noses into them and drank in a noisy way. Cashin prepared their meal: two slices each from the cannon-barrel dog sausage made by the butcher in Kenmare, three handfuls each of dry dog food. He got the dogs&#x2019; attention, took the bowls outside, placed them a metre apart. <br><br>The dogs came out. He told them to sit. Stomachs full of water, they did so slowly and with disdain, appeared to be arthritic. Given permission to eat, they looked at the food without interest, looked at each other, at him. Why have we been brought here to see this inedible stuff?<br><br>Cashin went inside. In his hip pocket, the mobile rang.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Joe?&#x2019; <br><br>Kendall Rogers, from the station. <br><br>&#x2018;Had a call from a lady,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Near Beckett. A Mrs Haig. She reckons there&#x2019;s someone in her shed.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Doing what?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, nothing. Her dog&#x2019;s barking. I&#x2019;ll sort it out.&#x2019;<br><br>Cashin felt his stubble. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s the address?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m going.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No point. Not far out of my way. Address?&#x2019; <br><br>He went to the kitchen table and wrote on the pad: date, time, incident, address. &#x2018;Tell her fifteen-twenty. Give her my number if anything happens before I get there.&#x2019;<br><br>The dogs liked his urgency, rushed around, made for the vehicle when he left the building. On the way, they stood on station, noses out the back windows. Cashin parked a hundred metres down the lane from the farmhouse gate. A head came around the hedge as he approached.<br><br>&#x2018;Cop?&#x2019; she said. She had dirty grey hair around a face cut from a hard wood with a blunt tool.<br><br>Cashin nodded.<br><br>&#x2018;The uniform and that?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Plainclothes,&#x2019; he said. He produced the Victoria Police badge with the emblem that looked like a fox. She took off her smudged glasses to study it.<br><br>&#x2018;Them police dogs?&#x2019; she said.<br><br>He looked back. Two woolly black heads in the same window.<br><br>&#x2018;They work with the police,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Where&#x2019;s this person?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Come,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Dog&#x2019;s inside, mad as a pork chop, the little bugger.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Jack Russell,&#x2019; said Cashin.<br><br>&#x2018;How&#x2019;d ya know that?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Just a guess.&#x2019;<br><br>They went around the house. He felt the fear rising in him like nausea.<br><br>&#x2018;In there,&#x2019; she said.<br><br>The shed was a long way from the house, you had to cross an expanse of overgrown garden, go through an opening in a fence lost beneath rampant potato-creeper. They walked to the gate. Beyond was knee-high grass, pieces of rusted metal sticking out.<br><br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s inside?&#x2019; Cashin said, looking at a rusted shed of corrugated iron a few metres from the road, a door half open. He felt sweat around his collarbones. He wished he&#x2019;d let Kendall do this.<br><br>Mrs Haig touched her chin, black spikes like a worn-down hair brush. &#x2018;Stuff,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Junk. The old truck. Haven&#x2019;t bin in there for years. Don&#x2019;t go in there.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Let the dog out,&#x2019; he said. <br><br>Her head jerked, alarmed. &#x2018;Bastard might hurt im,&#x2019; she said.<br><br>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s the dog&#x2019;s name?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Monty, call them all Monty, after Lord Monty of Alamein. Too young, you wouldn&#x2019;t know.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s right,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let Monty out.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And them police dogs? What bloody use are they?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Kept for life-and-death matters,&#x2019; Cashin said, controlling his voice. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be at the door, then you let Lord Monty out.&#x2019;<br>His mouth was dry, his scalp itched, these things would not have happened before Rai Sarris. He crossed the grassland, went to the left of the door. You learned early to keep your distance from potentially dangerous people and that included not going into dark sheds to meet them. <br><br>Mrs Haig was at the potato-creeper hedge. He gave her the thumbs up, his heart thumping.<br><br>The small dog came bounding through the grass, all tight muscles and yap, went for the shed, braked, stuck its head in the door and snarled, small body rigid with excitement.<br><br>Cashin thumped on the corrugated iron wall with his left hand. &#x2018;Police,&#x2019; he said loudly, glad to be doing something. &#x2018;Get out of there. Now!&#x2019;<br><br>Not a long wait.<br><br>The dog backed off, shrieking, hysterical, mostly airborne.<br><br>A man appeared in the doorway, hesitated, came out carrying a canvas swag. He ignored the dog. <br><br>&#x2018;On my way,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Just had a sleep.&#x2019; He was in his fifties perhaps, short grey hair, big shoulders, a day&#x2019;s beard.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>A Hand in the Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting</h2><p>Vaginal fisting - the intimate, potent sexual act of gradually inserting the entire hand into the vagina is an increasingly popular form of sexplay among lesbians, bisexuals and heterosexuals alike.

Then Ben had fought the men who held him down, and it had been done badly so that the wound had festered and he had nearly died. Now, kneeling tied and blindfolded in the claustrophobic dark of a wine cellar, beneath a house that was less than three years old and with the snuffed wicks of the candles sending rank smoke into the dark, he yearned for the touch of the iron. When the masked centurion wiped the wine down the line of his breastbone and pressed his thumb in the centre to mark the spot, he leaned forward to meet the pain.<br><br>He had forgotten how bad it would be. The shock was blinding. Fire, and something worse than fire, wrapped his heart, closing tight, like a fist. It wrenched at his breath in a way that wounds taken in battle had never done. He forced himself to silence but need not have done; the noise of one man was lost in the echoing chant of forty male voices. The stench of burned flesh drowned in a flood of sweet smoke as someone threw a fistful of incense onto the brazier.<br><br>Later he wondered at the expense of that: frankincense cost more than its own weight in gold. At the time, he only knew that, however briefly, the pain of the fire consumed the other, greater pain of his soul, and it was for this that he had come to the god. As to a lake on a hot day, he threw himself into it, riding the heat that spread from his chest until it drew him out of himself and he watched his body from a place apart, one with the fire and yet separate. At its height, when the bearable became unbearable, someone standing behind stripped the blindfold from his eyes and cut the cords at his wrists, and someone else lit the seven lamps before the sun-disc so that, in deepest darkness and blinding pain, the god's light offered solace.<br><br>He would have liked to accept the offer, to fall into the waiting, welcoming arms of the deity, to know peace and certain salvation. The men branded on either side of him did exactly that. From his left, he felt the shudder of flesh that matched exactly the moment of surrender when a horse first accepts the bridle. From his right, he heard a whimpered exhalation, as of a man at the climax of love. For these and the others beyond them, divine joy engulfed all pain, erasing its threat for ever.<br><br>It was what he had been promised and what he had craved. In an agony that was more of the heart than the body, he cried aloud in the void of his soul for the voice of the god: he was not answered. Too soon the iron was gone, leaving only the ache of scorched flesh and a curl of smoke that rose to join the taint of those who had been branded with him.<br><br>The centurion stepped back, swinging the reddening iron. The double curve of the raven blurred and steadied and lit the space between them. Hidden eyes regarded Valerius from behind the god's mask.<br><br>"Know now that you are my sons under the Sun, the last for whom I will be Father and special for ever because of it. I will leave this province soon, with the governor, traveling with him to Rome to accept such postings as the emperor chooses to bestow. I will be a centurion of the second cohort of the Praetorian Guard. Should you come to Rome, make yourselves known to me. The new governor will arrive with next month's first auspicious tide. With him will come new officers to replace those who are leaving and new recruits to replace those we have lost. Meantime the welfare of this province, the honour of our emperor and of the legions, is in your hands and those of your brothers under the god.<br><br>"You are his now, first and foremost. Before the legions, before all other gods, you belong to Mithras to death and beyond. He is a just god; ask and he will give you strength; weaken and he will destroy you. By the brand will you know and care for one another, and if the god grant that we meet again, I will know you by it also."<br><br>They were seven in the row, naked as infants, newly marked and newly named. Not one spoke. On the far side of the room, a man's voice set up the chant of the newborn. It was joined by others and others and, last, by the new initiates until the full weight of forty-nine voices surged onto the walls and fell inwards, deafeningly. As the sound faded, a single lamp was lit beneath the image of the god. The centurion turned and saluted. Behind him the others did likewise. From his place above the candle on the northern wall, smiling Mithras, capped and caped, caught his bull and drew his blade along its throat.<br><br><i>I<br>Autumn&#x2014;Winter A.D. 47</i><br><br><i>CHAPTER 1</i><br>Only the children sleep on the night before battle and sometimes not even them. On the night before the Roman governor of Britannia took ship and left for ever the land he had conquered, two thousand warriors and half as many dreamers gathered awake on a hillside, less than a morning's ride from the most westerly of the frontier forts. Singly and in groups, as their gods and their courage dictated, they prepared themselves for war on a scale not seen since the legions' invasion four years before.<br><br>Breaca nic Graine, once of the Eceni and now of Mona, sat alone at the edge of a mountain pool. She breathed on a pebble cupped in the palm of her hand and sent it skipping over the water.<br><br>"For luck."<br><br>The stone bounced five times, shattering the moon's reflection. Shards of broken light scattered into darkness and were lost. The river ran on unheard, the music of its passing drowned beneath the stutter of bear claws played on hollow skulls nearby. The light of a thousand restless campfires gilded the water's edge, and smoke hazed the air above it. Only by the river was there solitude and darkness and the peace to ask favours of the gods.<br><br>"For courage."<br><br>The second pebble clipped the edge of the moon and was lost. On the unseen slopes behind, the skull drums reached a crescendo. A woman's voice called to the gods in the language of the northern ancestors. Other voices answered, grunting, and the un-rhythm of the drums changed. It was not good to listen too closely to that; over the years, more than one soul had been lost in the mesh of woven bone-sounds and had never found its way home.<br><br>"For Briga's care in battle."<br><br>The third stone, more accurate than those before it, bounced nine times and sank into the moon's heart, carrying the prayer directly to the gods without the intermediary of the river. If a warrior wanted to believe in omens, it was a good one. Breaca, known as the Boudica, sat as the moon settled again and was whole, a crisp half-circle of silver lying still on a bed of moving black.<br><br>Stooping, she picked up a fourth stone. It was wider and flatter than the others and bounced smoothly on her palm. She breathed a different prayer into it, one for which tradition did not supply the words.<br><br>"For Caradoc and for Cunomar, for their joy and their peace if I am taken in battle. Briga, mother of war, of childbirth, and of dying, take care of them for me."<br><br>It was not a new prayer; in the three and a half years since her son was born, she had spoken it countless times in the silence of her mind in those moments before the first clash of combat when everything and everyone she loved must be put aside and forgotten. Breaca had learned early that a warrior who wished to live rode into battle with an empty mind lest the distraction of a rising memory should slow her sword arm or the lift of her shield. The difference now, in the rushing dark by the river, with the chaos of preparation held temporarily at bay, was that she had spoken for the first time aloud and had felt the prayer clearly heard. She was beside water, which was Nemain's, and on the eve of battle, which was Briga's, and the gods were alive and walking on the mountainside, called in by the scores of dreamers whose ceremonies lit the night sky.<br><br>After nearly four years of despair, she could feel the promise of freedom just within reach if only bone and blood and sinew could be pushed hard enough and far enough to make it happen. With the gods' help, she believed it could.<br><br>Knowing a hope greater than any she had felt since the invasion, the Boudica drew back her arm to throw her stone.<br><br>"Mama?"<br><br>"Cunomar!" She turned too fast. The pebble skittered over the water and was lost. A child stood on the river bank above her, tousled from sleep and stumbling uncertainly in the dark.<br><br>She reached up and lifted her son by the waist, bringing him down to the water's edge where he could stand safely. He was the living scion of her heart, her beacon in the dark, the one source of life that had pushed her to fight at the times when all hope seemed pointless. It hurt even to have him this close to battle. Holding him tight, she could feel the trip of his pulse. She kissed the top of his head and said, "My warrior, you should be sleeping, why are you not?"<br><br>Blearily, he rubbed a small fist in his eye. "The drums woke me. Ardacos is calling the she-bears to help him. He's going to fight the Romans. Can I watch the ceremony?"<br><br>Cunomar was not quite four years old and had only recently begun to grasp the enormity of war. Ardacos was his latest hero, second only to his father and mother in the pantheon of his gods. The small, savage Caledonian was the stuff of childhood idolatry. Ardacos led the band of warriors dedicated to the she-bear; they fought always on foot and largely naked and surpassed all others in the stalking and hunting of the enemy by night. The skull-drums were his, and the chanting that accompanied them.<br><br>Breaca smoothed a hand through the silk of her son's hair. She said, "We're all going to fight the Romans, but no, I think the ceremony is sacred and not for our eyes unless they call us in. When you are older, if the she-bear so grants, you can join with Ardacos in his ceremonies."<br><br>The boy's face flushed in the fire-glow, suddenly awake. "The she-bear will...</p><h2>Grandmother Spider: A Charlie Moon Mystery (Charlie Moon Series, 4)</h2><p><p>A lawman with a hardy appetite for life and an unshakable faith in the explicable, Southern Ute Acting Chief of Police Charlie Moon is not prepared to accept a purely supernatural explanation for the recent strange events of April 1. Nevertheless, something carried off Tommy Tonompicket and his unlikely drinking companion, research scientist William Pizinski, in the black chill of the Colorado night. And something ripped the head off a man outside a lonely cabin in the mountains...and left two large, fanglike punctures in his chest. And though Charlie's eccentric old aunt, the shaman Daisy Perika, claims the gargantuan avenging arachnid Grandmother Spider has risen up from the depths of Navajo Lake, the hulking, good-natured tribal policeman feels in his gut that this is murder, pure if not simple, and most probably by human hands.</p></p><p>It's pretty well understood that mysteries come with an implied contract. Authors, for their part, promise to deliver plots and resolutions, however improbable, with some degree of plausibility. Readers, in turn, give an author a 50-50 shot by turning down the gain on their innate disbelief. Then along comes <i>Grandmother Spider</i> and all bets are off.<p> Southern Ute tribal policeman Charlie Moon has a problem. It seems that, thanks to the imprudent squishing of a wayward spider, the giant spirit Grandmother Spider has risen from her cave below Navajo Lake and exacted revenge on humanity by snatching the research scientist William Pizinski and Tommy Tonompicket, the local carouser with whom he was drinking. Charlie knows this because the squisher was Sarah Frank, the 9-year-old ward of his elderly, shamanic, and altogether elsewhere aunt, Daisy Perika. And Daisy got it straight from a dwarfish spirit called a <i>pitukupf</i>.</p><p> </p><blockquote>The <i>pitukupf</i> half smiled, exposing jagged rows of yellowed teeth. He vigorously stirred the crooked stick in the embers under the apparition, kindling new flames. The dwarf ceremoniously lifted the helical baton like a conductor calling dark chords from an unseen orchestra. The glowing sparks swirled up the column of heated air... and the hideous image of the eight-legged creature followed. As it ascended, the grayish form took on the bright orange hue of the yellow flames beneath it. The apparition grew larger, the entrapped man struggled vainly in hope of release. And screamed piteously for someone to help him.</blockquote> And that's not the half of it. Before long, Charlie and his friend, Granite Creek Police Chief Scott Parris, are up to their gun belts in national security issues, mutilated bodies, hideous creatures roaming the countryside snatching sandwiches from the mouths of 80-year-olds, and the bizarre reappearance of the two missing and now-amnesiac tipplers. And, happily, that's still not the half of it.<p> <i>Grandmother Spider</i> is Charlie Moon's sixth, strangest, and perhaps funniest airing (from 1994's <i>The Shaman Sings</i> through 1999's <i>The Night Visitor</i>). With mystery and mysticism enough to satisfy Hillerman's fans, and humor, memorable characterization, and good writing enough to satisfy everyone else, who's going to quibble about a silly old contract? <i>-- Michael Hudson</i></p>James D.

His early career as a journalist, included a stint as Features Editor for <i>Variety</i>. &nbsp;He is the author of two non-fiction books, <i>Out of Focus</i> and <i>Cop Without A Badge</i>&nbsp;(recently reissued)<b>&nbsp;</b>and the novels <i>Hell's Kitchen Homicide </i>and <i>Crystal Death </i>(coming September 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kipps (Out of Focus) deftly labels Maher an "excitement junkie," and the aptness of that term is clear from the first paragraph of this high-speed bio. From a broken home, Maher early became addicted to fast cars, and at 17, driving a stolen car, he led police on a wild chase from the Bronx in New York City to the Catskills. For this he got a prison sentence of up to four years. After escape and re-incarceration, he had the good fortune to encounter detective Jim Doherty, who became a second father to him. He then built a career as a confidential informant for various police departments, the FBI and the DEA. His fascination with fast cars continuing, he met at a drag-racing strip the scion of one of Colombia's drug families and for several years was a serious cocaine addict whose habit wrecked his first two marriages and derailed his career as an informant. Eventually he conquered his addiction and now works for a security firm in New Jersey. From all the derring-do here emerges the portrait of a man who never grew up.

For this edition, a new chapter on Dante and his time provides a useful transition to the Renaissance from the culture of the Middle Ages. There are also new selections on warfare, education, Florence, humanism, the Church, and the later Renaissance. The introductions to the readings are revised, and an essay on how to read historical documents is included.</p></p><p><b>Kenneth R. Bartlett</b> is Professor of History and Renaissance Studies at the University of Toronto. He is the author of <i>The English in Italy 1525&#x2013;1558: A Study in Culture and Politics</i> (1991), <i>The Civilization of the Italian Renaissance: A Sourcebook</i> (2011), and <i>A Short History of the Italian Renaissance</i> (2013).Kenneth R. Bartlett has produced a fine second edition of his already useful sourcebook. Reflecting important recent research, he has added material on the social, economic, religious, political, and intellectual world of Italy from the late thirteenth to the sixteenth century. The texts are well suited for discussion and can be readily linked to lectures. For its accessibility and breadth of primary sources, this stimulating sourcebook is excellent and can be wholeheartedly recommended. (Edward D. English, University of California, Santa Barbara)<br><br>This is by far the best collection of readings for a semester-length course on the Italian Renaissance. What makes it unique is the balance between the usual literary sources and documents relating to political, economic, and family history, including the lives of women, marginalized people, and the poor. The magnificent range of sources is matched by the quality of the selections themselves, which bring to life the period in all of its complexity. I am particularly pleased to see that the second edition includes readings placing the Renaissance within the context of Dante's world. (J. Laurel Carrington, St. Olaf College)<br><br>I have used this book's predecessor since it first came out because it was easily the best such reader available. The new edition is signally improved not only by the addition of Dante as well as a number of other new readings but also by a handy and mercifully short guide to reading historical documents. The organization is also improved which makes it easier to find texts by the same author. (Thomas F. Mayer, Augustana College)<br><br>Kenneth Bartlett's <i>The Civilization of the Italian Renaissance</i> has long been my favorite sourcebook for undergraduate teaching; I could not be happier that it is coming back into print, and updated no less, so that I can assign it as a textbook. I teach a range of courses in the Renaissance, from broad art history surveys, to upper-division lectures and seminars, to interdisciplinary classes&#x2014;all of which have benefited from this book. Bartlett has assembled not only the best sources, but the best selections from those sources. This is not a collage of short, obscure, or mystifying documents; rather, it is a collection of the most important thinkers and artists of the Renaissance, at their pithiest moments. For example, Alberti's <i>On Painting</i>, Vasari's <i>Life of Michelangelo</i>, and Cellini's <i>Vita</i> are all key texts that are too long and complex for most classes. Bartlett's selections from each are perfectly excised at the ideal length for teaching, and with their key themes intact. The book is endlessly adaptable to subject area (it includes art historical, literary, historical/political and philosophical sources) and to style of class&#x2014;any material could be safely assigned to a lower-level Renaissance class, but much is in-depth enough for an upper-level lecture or seminar. There is no equivalent compendium of Renaissance sources for undergraduate teaching, which is why I have spent the last several years copying selections from the copy I purchased when it was assigned to me as an undergraduate textbook in 1994. I could not be happier to see this valuable teaching tool re-released, and to have the opportunity to share its contents with my students, as they were once shared with me.

The same is true for daffodils, streams, and stars. But man-made creations-especially the towns and buildings of the 20th century-have only occasionally been really good, more often mediocre, and in the last 50 years have very often been deadly. What is the reason for the difference?</p><p>In Book 2, Alexander explains in detail the kinds of process that are capable of generating living structure. The unfolding of living structure in natural systems is compared to the unfolding of buildings and town plans in traditional society, and then contrasted with present-day building processes.</p><p>The comparison reveals deep and shocking problems which pervade the present day planning and construction of buildings. Pervasive changes are needed to create a world in which living process-and hence living structure-are possible; these are changes which are ultimately attainable only through a transformation of society.</p><p>It is the use of sequences which makes it possible for each building to become unique, exactly fitted to its context, and harmonious. And it is also this use of sequences which makes it possible for people to participate effectively in the layout of their own buildings and communities.</p><p>"This will change the world as effectively as the advent of printing changed the world . . ."-Doug Carlston, Silicon Valley luminary and former president of Broderbund</p><p><b>Christopher Alexander</b> is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, architect, builder, and author of many books and technical papers.

Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work -- exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward "the peculiar institution" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families "sold down the river." An immediate international sensation, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> sold 300,000 copies in the first year, was translated into thirty-seven languages, and has never gone out of print: its political impact was immense, its emotional influence immeasurable.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Sideshow</h2><p>On the planet of Elsewhere, the Council had&nbsp;&nbsp;always enforced the governing of each province in&nbsp;&nbsp;the manner the people had chosen, so long as each&nbsp;&nbsp;respected its neighbors' local customs--and so long&nbsp;&nbsp;as the people remained within their homelands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generations later, inhabitants have begun to question&nbsp;&nbsp;this tradition.

And Eric Foner, in <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, wrote that "the issues it raises are indispensable for understanding nineteenth-century America." It won the coveted Bancroft Prize in American History and has since become the standard source on American law for the period between 1780 and 1860. Now, Horwitz presents <em>The Transformation of American Law, 1870 to 1960</em>, the long-awaited sequel that brings his sweeping history to completion. <br> In his pathbreaking first volume, Horwitz showed how economic conflicts helped transform law in antebellum America. Here, Horwitz picks up where he left off, tracing the struggle in American law between the entrenched legal orthodoxy and the Progressive movement, which arose in response to ever-increasing social and economic inequality. Horwitz introduces us to the people and events that fueled this contest between the Old Order and the New. We sit in on <em>Lochner v. New York</em> in 1905--where the new thinkers sought to undermine orthodox claims for the autonomy of law--and watch as Progressive thought first crystallized. We meet Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and recognize the influence of his incisive ideas on the transformation of law in America. We witness the culmination of the Progressive challenge to orthodoxy with the emergence of Legal Realism in the 1920s and '30s, a movement closely allied with other intellectual trends of the day. And as postwar events unfold--the rise of totalitarianism abroad, the McCarthyism rampant in our own country, the astonishingly hostile academic reaction to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>--we come to understand that, rather than self-destructing as some historians have asserted, the Progressive movement was alive and well and forming the roots of the legal debates that still confront us today.<br> The Progressive legacy that this volume brings to life is an enduring one, one which continues to speak to us eloquently across nearly a century of American life. In telling its story, Horwitz strikes a balance between a traditional interpretation of history on the one hand, and an approach informed by the latest historical theory on the other. Indeed, Horwitz's rich view of American history--as seen from a variety of perspectives--is undertaken in the same spirit as the Progressive attacks on an orthodoxy that believed law an objective, neutral entity.<br> <em>The Transformation of American Law</em> is a book certain to revise past thinking on the origins and evolution of law in our country. For anyone hoping to understand the structure of American law--or of America itself--this volume is indispensable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Morton J. Horwitz</strong> is Charles Warren Professor of American Legal History at the Harvard Law School.<br>In an important and long-awaited sequel to his classic Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860 (1977), Horwitz tells how the Progressive movement--a program for political and economic as well as legal reform--transformed American legal thought from a search for impartial norms into a discipline that acknowledged the elasticity of its own rules and that borrowed the methodologies and some of the values of the social sciences. Horwitz describes the Progressive movement (and its progeny, the Legal Realism movement of the 1920's and 1930's) as an assault on ``classical legal thought''--the view that the law constitutes an impartial body of rules administered by neutral arbiters. The author argues that centralization of the American economy--with the accompanying problems of urbanization, immigration, industrialism, and polarization of economic classes--led to a gradual reexamination of classical legal thought, particularly the bias in legal orthodoxy against redistribution of wealth. Horwitz describes how economic and, ultimately, social changes brought about by WW I put irresistible pressure on courts and legal scholars to bring jurisprudential thought into closer touch with America's rapidly changing society. But, Horwitz explains, it was the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Lochner v. New York (1905)--which invalidated a maximum-hours law for bakers on the grounds that it unconstitutionally interfered with the freedom of contract--that truly catalyzed the attacks of Progressive legal scholars on the claim that law was a politically neutral science. Through a discussion of the evolution of thought in specialized legal fields and problems, and by offering short sketches about the thought of influential figures of the period like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Legal Realists Karl Llewellyn and Jerome Frank, Horwitz demonstrates that the effect of the new thinking on American law was pervasive and lasting. Finally, he argues persuasively that the Legal Realist tradition has had an extensive effect on the development of American law in the post-WW II period. An excellent and significant reexamination of the work and impact of the Progressive and Realist legal thinkers. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But did he do it, as he suggests in his <i>Essays</i>, by retreating to his chateau, turning his back on the world, and stoically detaching himself from his violent times? In this definitive biography, Philippe Desan, one of the world's leading authorities on Montaigne, overturns this longstanding myth by showing that Montaigne was constantly concerned with realizing his political ambitions&#x2015;and that the literary and philosophical character of the <i>Essays </i>largely depends on them. The most comprehensive and authoritative biography of Montaigne yet written, this sweeping narrative offers a fascinating new picture of his life and work.</p><p>As Desan shows, Montaigne always considered himself a political figure and he conceived of each edition of the <i>Essays </i>as an indispensable prerequisite to the next stage of his public career. He lived through eight civil wars, successfully lobbied to be raised to the nobility, and served as mayor of Bordeaux, special ambassador, and negotiator between Henry III and Henry of Navarre. It was only toward the very end of Montaigne&#x2019;s life, after his political failure, that he took refuge in literature. But, even then, it was his political experience that enabled him to find the right tone for his genre.</p><p>In this essential biography, we discover a new Montaigne&#x2015;caught up in the events of his time, making no separation between private and public life, and guided by strategy first in his words and silences. Neither candid nor transparent, but also not yielding to the cynicism of his age, this Montaigne lends a new depth to the Montaigne of literary legend.</p></p><p><p>"The new standard biography of Montaigne. Phillipe Desan throws new light on Montaigne's rewriting of the <i>Essays</i> through a study of his changing political aspirations."<b>--Peter Mack, University of Warwick</b></p><p>"This biography is thoroughly illuminating and it is difficult to imagine that it could be bettered. It will surely hold the field for decades."<b>--Michael Moriarty, University of Cambridge</b></p><p>"Philippe Desan's biography offers a refreshing corrective to those Lives of Montaigne that have underplayed his political activities and aspirations by presenting his literary activities as belonging to their own autonomous sphere. The book offers some intriguing new interpretations, including a compelling account of the different circumstances that surround--and intentions that may animate--the various editions of the <i>Essays</i>."<b>--Richard Scholar, University of Oxford</b></p><b>Philippe Desan</b> is the Howard L.

Why is a/b successful in encouraging girls and women to unwittingly embrace their would-be murderer? How can such a murderer be exposed and thwarted? This book details a unique way of thinking and speaking about anorexia/bulimia. By having conversations with insiders in which the problem is viewed as an external influence rather than a part of the person, these therapists show how to bring the tactics of a/b into the open, expose its deceptions, break its spell, and encourage defiance of its tyrannical rule. These innovations enable insiders, professionals, and loved ones to unite against anorexia/bulimia rather than allowing a/b to pit a professional or loved one against an insider, and the insider against herself. Coercion is sidestepped in favor of practices that are collaborative, accountable and spirit-nurturing. The groundbreaking discoveries outlined in this book will provide new options, inspiration and hope, not only for those who suffer at anorexia's hands, but also for their loved ones and healthcare professionals.</p><p><p><strong>Richard Maisel, Ph.D</strong>. is an adjunct professor at Alliant International University in San Francisco and maintains a private practice in Berkeley and Walnut Creek, California.

By applying the highly effective methods of narrative therapy, the authors emphasize the very real potential for effective treatment of these devastating problems. This book offers not only welcome hope to those frustrated with the current state of &#x2018;eating disorder&#x2019; treatment but it also provides a lifeline of language to those who are trapped in the terrible silence of anorexia/bulimia.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marya Hornbacher, author of <i>Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia</i></strong></p><h2>Drugs, Society and Criminal Justice</h2><p><p> <em>For courses in Drugs and Crime, Drugs and Criminal Justice, Drugs and Society, and The Sociology of Substance Abuse</em> </p> <p> <strong> <em>Drugs, Society, and Criminal Justice</em> </strong> is a highly readable introduction to the major facts and issues concerning criminal justice and drug-taking behavior in America today.

Translators Thupten Jinpa&#x2014;one of the Dalai Lama's principal interpreters&#x2014;and Jas' Elsner have created an accessible collection geared toward a general audience. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, poetry has long been one of the primary means of expressing spiritual experience. The splendid poems in this collection communicate spiritual insight with astonishing grace and precision. <i>Songs of Spiritual Experience </i> includes original translations of fifty-two poems, a lengthy introduction about the role of poetry in Tibetan Buddhism, and a helpful glossary that includes commentary on the poems. The book serves both as an introduction to Tibetan poetry and to Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.</p><p>THUPTEN JINPA is the principal English translator for the Dalai Lama. He holds a PhD in religious studies from Cambridge University, as well as a Lharam degree, the Tibetan equivalent to a doctorate in divinity. He is president of the Institute of Tibetan Classics, an organization dedicated to translating key classical Tibetan texts into contemporary languages. JA&#x15a; ELSNER is a senior research fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford University. He has published widely on the topics of art and religion.The West has shown an almost inexhaustible interest in the spiritual teachings of the Buddhist East, and Tibet in particular has evoked a special fascination. It is not difficult now to read in English the major and minor Buddhist scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism, but until now there has not been a collection of related poetry in a Western language. This anthology from Jinpa (the Dalai Lama's principal translator) and Elsner's anthology makes a strong case for the spiritual importance of this poetic tradition, and their translations are, by and large, readable and somewhat less forbidding than some of the long prose instructions characteristic of Buddhist scripture. Poetry makes the insights more accessible: "When I first began meditating,/ I felt a surge of bliss,/ like a couple in love gazing on each other." A fine volume; recommended for collections where there is interest in Buddhism. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Discovering French, Nouveau!: Student Edition Level 2 2007</h2><p>A textbook for students who have made some progress in learning French offers instruction in speaking, understanding, reading, and writing the language.</p><p></p><h2>The Chair: Rethinking Culture, Body, and Design</h2><p><p><strong>"Engaged in fascinating and useful multidisciplinary research, Cranz is an avatar for body-friendly design. . . . Read [<em>The Chair</em>] and cheer."--Elizabeth Zimmer, <em>Village Voice</em></strong></p> Perhaps no other object of our daily environment has had the enduring cultural significance of the ever-present chair, unconsciously yet forcefully shaping the physical and social dimensions of our lives. With over ninety illustrations, this book traces the history of the chair as we know it from its crudest beginnings up through the modern office variety. Drawing on anecdotes, literary references, and famous designs, Galen Cranz documents our ongoing love affair with the chair and how its evolution has been governed not by a quest for comfort or practicality, but by the designation of status.Relating much of the modern era's rampant back pain to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle spent in traditional seating, Cranz goes beyond traditional ergonomic theory to formulate new design principles that challenge the way we think and live.

This Norton Critical Edition is based on the first published edition of the novel. It is accompanied by explanatory footnotes, key illustrations, an introduction that gives readers a historical overview of both author and novel, and a note on the text.<br><br> &#x201c;Contexts and Backgrounds&#x201d; is a rich collection of materials organized around the novel&#x2019;s central themes: &#x201c;Autobiographical and Biographical Writings,&#x201d; &#x201c;Letters,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Americanization and Immigration.&#x201d; Willa Cather, Edith Lewis, Latrobe Carroll, Rose C. Feld, Guy Reynolds, Woodrow Wilson, Peter Roberts, Horace M. Kallen, Sarka B. Hrbkova, and Rose Rosicky, among others, are included.<br><br> &#x201c;Criticism&#x201d; spans a century of scholarship on Willa Cather and <em>My �ntonia</em>, from contemporary reviews by Henry Walcott Boynton, H. L. Mencken, and Elia W. Peattie, among others, to recent critical assessments by Terence Martin, Blanche Gelfant, Jean Schwind, Richard H. Millington, Susan Rosowski, Mike Fischer, Janis Stout, Marilee Lindemann, and Linda Joyce Brown.<br><br> A Chronology of Cather&#x2019;s life and work and a Selected Bibliography are also included.<br></p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world. <p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p> <p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Do narratives about the Holocaust have a special obligation to be 'truthful'--that is, faithful to the facts of history?<br>Or is it okay to lie in such works? <br><br>In her provocative study <em>A Thousand Darknesses</em>, Ruth Franklin investigates these questions as they arise in the most significant works of Holocaust fiction, from Tadeusz Borowski's Auschwitz stories to Jonathan Safran Foer's postmodernist family history. Franklin argues that the memory-obsessed culture of the last few decades has led us to mistakenly focus on testimony as the only valid form of Holocaust writing. As even the most canonical texts have come under scrutiny for their fidelity to the facts, we have lost sight of the essential role that imagination plays in the creation of any literary work, including the memoir. <br><br>Taking a fresh look at memoirs by Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi, and examining novels by writers such as Piotr Rawicz, Jerzy Kosinski, W.G. Sebald, and Wolfgang Koeppen, Franklin makes a persuasive case for literature as an equally vital vehicle for understanding the Holocaust (and for memoir as an equally ambiguous form). The result is a study of immense depth and range that offers a lucid view of an often cloudy field.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ruth Franklin</strong> is a senior editor at <em>The New Republic</em>.<br><br>"Ruth Franklin's new book, <em>A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction,</em> is more than a towering work of criticism and insight -- it's an invaluable corrective." <br>--<em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br>"By scrupulously defending the integrity of literature, Ms. Franklin has offered her own eloquent testimony." <br>--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Franklin explicates her central ideas with a piercing, graceful lucidity... a beautiful book that addresses the ugliest of subjects, proving, once more, that it can be done." <br>--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"This text is superbly written and offers insightful analysis." <br>--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Ruth Franklin's keen analysis makes a major contribution to the literary criticism of Shoah writers, and her humane perspective renders the nuances of a fraught subject newly comprehensible." <br>--<em>Jewish Book Council</em><p></p><br>"...an honest effort to inject a little good sense and judgment into an understandably emotional subject." <br>--<em>Jewish Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"...a brilliant, challenging and surprising work." <br>--<em>Jewish Journal</em><p></p><br>"What <em>A Thousand Darknesses</em> does do, and does very well, is challenge us on every level of virtually every aspect of Holocaust literature.

Literature lays bare the path to know what is knowable, and Franklin neatly shows us the way." <br>--<em>The Jewish Daily Forward</em><p></p><br>"A Thousand Darknesses succeeds in forming a coherent whole that makes a powerful argument for the propriety of treating the Holocaust as a wellspring of literary art." <br>--<em>Commentary</em> <br><p></p><br>"Franlin is particularly astute in evaluating why the grayness of truth is important in a Holocaust work...

Massey Sr. Lectures in the History of American Civilization)</h2><p><p> In this unusually wide-ranging study, spanning more than a century and covering such diverse forms of expressive culture as Shakespeare, Central Park, symphonies, jazz, art museums, the Marx Brothers, opera, and vaudeville, a leading cultural historian demonstrates how variable and dynamic cultural boundaries have been and how fragile and recent the cultural categories we have learned to accept as natural and eternal are. </p><p> For most of the nineteenth century, a wide variety of expressive forms--Shakespearean drama, opera, orchestral music, painting and sculpture, as well as the writings of such authors as Dickens and Longfellow--enjoyed both high cultural status and mass popularity. In the nineteenth century Americans (in addition to whatever specific ethnic, class, and regional cultures they were part of) shared a public culture less hierarchically organized, less fragmented into relatively rigid adjectival groupings than their descendants were to experience. By the twentieth century this cultural eclecticism and openness became increasingly rare. Cultural space was more sharply defined and less flexible than it had been. The theater, once a microcosm of America--housing both the entire spectrum of the population and the complete range of entertainment from tragedy to farce, juggling to ballet, opera to minstrelsy--now fragmented into discrete spaces catering to distinct audiences and separate genres of expressive culture. The same transition occurred in concert halls, opera houses, and museums. A growing chasm between "serious" and "popular," between "high" and "low" culture came to dominate America's expressive arts. </p><p> "If there is a tragedy in this development," Levine comments, "it is not only that millions of Americans were now separated from exposure to such creators as Shakespeare, Beethoven, and Verdi, whom they had enjoyed in various formats for much of the nineteenth century, but also that the rigid cultural categories, once they were in place, made it so difficult for so long for so many to understand the value and importance of the popular art forms that were all around them. Too many of those who considered themselves educated and cultured lost for a significant period--and many have still not regained--their ability to discriminate independently, to sort things out for themselves and understand that simply because a form of expressive culture was widely accessible and highly popular it was not therefore necessarily devoid of any redeeming value or artistic merit." </p><p> In this innovative historical exploration, Levine not only traces the emergence of such familiar categories as highbrow and lowbrow at the turn of the century, but helps us to understand more clearly both the process of cultural change and the nature of culture in American society. </p></p><p>&#39;Provides just the kind of balanced, historically informed assessment that can be of immediate value at a time when appeals to eternal truth fly thick and fast.&#39;Lawrence W. Levine was an American historian noted for promoting multiculturalism and the perspectives of ordinary people in the study of history.</p><h2>Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third World Feminism (Thinking Gender)</h2><p><em>Dislocating Cultures</em> takes aim at the related notions of nation, identity, and tradition to show how Western and Third World scholars have misrepresented Third World cultures and feminist agendas. Drawing attention to the political forces that have spawned, shaped, and perpetuated these misrepresentations since colonial times, Uma Narayan inspects the underlying problems which "culture" poses for the respect of difference and cross-cultural understanding.<br><br>Questioning the problematic roles assigned to Third World subjects within multiculturalism, Narayan examines ways in which the flow of information across national contexts affects our understanding of issues. <em>Dislocating Cultures</em> contributes a philosophical perspective on areas of ongoing interest such as nationalism, post-colonial studies, and the cultural politics of debates over tradition and "westernization" in Third World contexts.</p><p>Dislocating Cultures takes aim at the related notions of nation, identity, and tradition to show how Western and Third World scholars have misrepresented Third world cultures and feminist agendas.<strong>Uma Narayan</strong> is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vassar College.</p><h2>Arms and Equipment of the Civil War</h2><p>The first military conflict to use iron-clad gunboats, metallic cartridges, and submarines, the Civil War also introduced such inventions as the telegraph and military balloon, utilized by the Signal Corps.

This new edition continues the thrust of the first edition in presenting, documenting, and analyzing vignettes about human beings from a minority perspective. Even The Rat Was White views history from all perspectives in the quest for historical accuracy. Histories and other background materials are presented in detail concerning early Black American psychologists and their scientific contributions, as well as their problems, views, and concerns of the field of psychology. Archival documents that are not often found in mainstream resources are uncovered through the use of journals and magazines, such as the Journal of Black Psychology, the Journal of Negro Education, and Crisis. The text is divided into two parts. Part I, &#34;Psychology and Racial Differences,&#34; expands and updates historical materials that helped form racial stereotypes and negative views towards Black Americans. Part II, &#34;Psychology and Psychologists,&#34; is updated with specifics of what and how psychology was taught in the pre-1970 Black colleges, and brings forward the contributions of Black psychologists. Part III, &#34;Conclusion,&#34; discusses the implication of the previous chapters and the impact of new historical information on the field of psychology.</p><p>Key Benefit:When the first edition of this book was published twenty years ago, it broke new ground. The psychological community was beginning to address the question of racial and other biases in psychological theories, research, and testing. But the controversial publication of The Bell Curve in 1995 showed that progress has been slow. Robert Guthrie&#39;s enlightened discussion is still much needed today. In fact, diversity in psychology is the theme of this year&#39;s American Psychology Association (APA) convention to be held in Chicago in mid-August. Key Topics: Robert Guthrie&#39;s enlightened discussion on racial considerations and Euro-American attitudes is still much needed today. This controversial book brings to light some of the more bizarre turns the study of human differences has taken. Studies which supported Black inferiority were immediately accepted while studies which questioned white superiority and demonstrated cultural bias in methodologies were pushed aside. You&#39;ll find: how European explorers and slave ship captains viewed the Africans they met, and how these attitudes influenced European and American ideas for centuries; why the concerns of psychologists who questioned biased research were ignored; how racist psychological arguments were used to show why desegregation wouldn&#39;t work; the hardships faced by minority psychologists and their often-overlooked contributions to the field. Market: This book belongs on the shelves of all new and practicing psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists.</p><h2>The Enneagram Type 3: The Successful Achiever (The Enneagram Collection)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Type 3: The Successful Achiever</em></strong><strong>, from The Enneagram Collection, is for anyone who loves the Enneagram and wants to go deeper with this interactive book exploring the unique motivations, longings, and strengths and weaknesses of a Type 3&#x2014;those who have a core desire to be valuable, admired, and respected.</strong></p><p>The Enneagram has never been more popular.

With targeted and revelatory questions, you&#x2019;ll be prompted to explore your own personal narrative&#x2014;to write honestly about your deepest wounds, greatest challenges, hidden gifts, yearnings, and opportunities for growth&#x2014;in order to discover a deeply authentic understanding of yourself and move toward a more liberated, truthful life.</p><p>We each have our own story, a personal myth constructed from the content life presents us: we connect dots to shape the narrative, devise plotlines from circumstance, change characters, fashion conflicts, and adjust structure, settings, and themes as our lives unfold. But so often, over time, we come to believe that we <i>are</i> our story, identifying so strongly with the tales we&#x2019;ve told ourselves and others that we cling to them for our very existence&#x2014;even when they don&#x2019;t quite fit. The realization that there&#x2019;s a discrepancy between the narrative you&#x2019;ve crafted and your authentic self can be disconcerting at first, but the exploration of that gap is a doorway to personal freedom, and this book will lead you through it.</p><p>The writing exercises in this guide, one for nearly every week of the year, ask you to tell the whole truth about your experience. In doing so, you&#x2019;ll come to realize that once you engage in this radical truth-telling, expressing yourself with complete honesty, your story changes; and when your story changes, your life is transformed. Rather than sticking with your illusive and tricky &#x201c;Story of Me,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll be prompted to go even deeper, piercing your personal myth and illuminating aspects of psyche and spirit that give way to profound moments of understanding and personal healing.</p><p>This is not a how-to book for writers; it&#x2019;s an invitation on a journey of self-discovery&#x2014;a guide to facing yourself without flinching, accepting yourself as you are, surrendering to what is, and daring to question and transform what isn&#x2019;t true. With <i>Writing to Awaken</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn how to break free from the trance of mistaken identity and discover your essential, authentic self.</p></p><p><b>Mark Matousek</b> is author of two award-winning memoirs, <i>Sex Death Enlightenment</i> (an international bestseller) and <i>The Boy He Left Behind</i> (a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Discovery Book), as well as <i>When You&#x2019;re Falling, Dive</i> and <i>Ethical Wisdom</i>.

This is a brilliant attempt to redefine problems that have long challenged the Western world in its search for understanding both God and man.&nbsp;&#x201c;The compact, closely reasoned book employs a skill in logic reminiscent of scholasticism at its best to refute traditional notions, scholastic and otherwise, of divine absoluteness, and to expound a conception of God which is both free of contradiction and religiously adequate. The position taken is described by Professor Hartshorne as surrelativism, or panentheism, and these terms indicate the two major emphases of the volume....He who follows its precise logic with the alertness it demands will have a clarifying and enriching experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;S.

Of course, it's not just the Black kids sitting together the White, Latino, Asian Pacific, and in some regions, American Indian youth, are clustered in their own groups, too. The same phenomenon can be observed in college dining halls, faculty lounges, and in corporate cafeterias.What is going on here? Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about the other questions we and our children have about race?Beverly Daniel Tatum is a renowned authority on the psychology of racism. She asserts that we do not know how to talk about our racial differences: Whites are afraid of using the wrong words and being perceived as racist.&#x201d; Parents of color are afraid of exposing their children to painful racial realities too soon. Tatum understands that the vocabulary of race is loaded and that embarrassment and awkwardness often stymie conversations about this subject; yet, she believes that these obstacles can and must be overcome if we are to bring about change.In <i> Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?&#x201d; And Other Conversations About Race,</i> Dr. Tatum provides us with a new way of thinking and talking about race through the lens of racial identity. She explains that all of us have a racial identity and must strive to affirm it. For people of color, the development of a constructive racial identity requires being able to recognize and reject the bombardment of negative stereotypes and to embrace a history of resistance and empowerment rather than passive victimization. For Whites, the challenge is to engage in a process of racial identity development which leads to an awareness of White privilege and a determination to actively work against injustice and this requires the strength to reject a system that awards them, and to reclaim the legacy of White allies. For many, this is uncharted territory. This book provides a road map for those who want to make the journey and better understand the racial dynamics of their daily lives.Tatum extends her ideas about racial identity development beyond the usual Black-White paradigm to embrace the unique circumstances of Latinos, American Indians, Asians, as well as biracial youth. Also included is a list of resources for further reading as well as a list of books for parents and teachers to recommend to children of all ages.Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities whatever they may be is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides. We have waited far too long to begin our conversations about race. This remarkable book, infused with great wisdom and humanity, tells us where to start.</p><p>Anyone who&#39;s been to a high school or college has noted how students of the same race seem to stick together. Beverly Daniel Tatum has noticed it too, and she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s so bad. As she explains in this provocative, though not-altogether-convincing book, these students are in the process of establishing and affirming their racial identity. As Tatum sees it, blacks must secure a racial identity free of negative stereotypes. The challenge to whites, on which she expounds, is to give up the privilege that their skin color affords and to work actively to combat injustice in society.<b>Beverly Daniel Tatum, Ph.D.,</b> is a professor of psychology and dean of Mount Holyoke College as well as a psychologist in private practice.

Zornberg brings biblical, midrashic, and literary sources together, weaving them into a seamless tapestry and illuminating the tensions that grip human beings as they search for and encounter God.</p><p>In her first book, Genesis: The Beginning of Desire, based on her immensely popular weekly lectures in Jerusalem, Avivah Zornberg reanimates the ancient characters of the Bible through her lyrical prose and modern sensibilities. Zornberg illumines the inevitable tensions that grip human beings as they search for and encounter God: the disorder that threatens order, the instability that shatters stability. On the one hand, she writes, we are reassured to find our own tensions reflected in these ancient texts. But on the other hand, the midrashic strategy we bring to the texts will not comfort us with a formalized, serenely fixed image of human life, with pious homiletical messages to shore up our insecurities. For the Torah that seemed so accessible is more multi-layered than we knew; it can be approached only by the strenuous and imaginative &#39;making&#39; of the reader.In these reflections on Genesis, Cambridge scholar Zornberg combines the contributions of contemporary biblical criticism, in-depth exegesis, and prosaic exposition to produce spectacular readings of this first book of Torah. Basing this book on weekly lectures given in Jerusalem, Zornberg attempts to lead her hearers and readers beyond the fixed meanings so often ascribed to the biblical text. Instead, her readings urge readers to take seriously their task of cocreating the meanings of the text. A beautiful and arresting exercise in biblical literary criticism; highly recommended.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Earth After Us: What Legacy Will Humans Leave in the Rocks?</h2><p>Geologist Jan Zalasiewicz takes the reader on a fascinating trip one hundred million years into the future--long after the human race becomes extinct--to explore what will remain of our brief but dramatic sojourn on Earth. He describes how geologists in the far future might piece together the history of the planet, and slowly decipher the history of humanity from the traces we will leave impressed in the rock strata. What story will the rocks tell of us? What kind of fossils will humans leave behind? What will happen to cities, cars, and plastic cups? The trail leads finally to the bones of the inhabitants of petrified cities that have slept deep underground for many millions of years. As thought-provoking as it is engaging, this book simultaneously explains the geological mechanisms that shape our planet, from fossilization to plate tectonics, illuminates the various ingenious ways in which geologists and paleontologist work, and offers a final perspective on humanity and its actions that may prove to be more objective than any other.</p><p><br><strong>Jan Zalasiewicz</strong> is a Lecturer in Geology at the University of Leicester, before that working at the British Geological Survey.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>Branningan&#39;s Building Construction for the Fire Service</h2><p>The Fourth Edition honors Frank Brannigan s legacy by continuing his passion for detail and extensive practical experience.

("Isn't it a little like being an actor?" she asked, presciently, given the shape of modern broadcast news.) Schorr's narrative begins before the Second World War, when, the son of Russian immigrants, he combed the streets of New York looking for news stories and eventually talking his way onto the staffs of newspapers and wire services. He had a gift for being in the right place at the right time, breaking news in the summer of 1941 that pointed to an impending war with Japan and reporting on the hostilities that followed the creation of the state of Israel, among many other events. That gift served him well as he rose through the ranks of foreign correspondents, eventually joining CBS and heading the network's bureaus in Bonn and Moscow, where he came to spend more time talking with Nikita Khrushchev than he would spend with the American presidents he was later charged with covering. Schorr had another gift: a particularly fine ability to irritate those who came under his scrutiny, from John Wayne to John Kennedy, from the KGB to the FBI. "It may be that I am just hard to get along with, but to me it always seemed that some principle was involved."</p><p> Irascibility and high principle alike mark this memoir. Readers who grew up listening to Schorr's reports on such matters as Watergate and the Berlin Wall, as well as students of journalism and history, will find it illuminating. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Daniel Schorr</b> has covered the news for more than six decades.

Yet today men mine valuable resources by whatever method brings the greatest profit in the shortest time, leaving the earth ravaged. They hunt and fish for pleasure, not food, leaving animal carcasses behind to rot. They worship self and ignore the God who made them.</p> <p>The answer to the ecological crises of our day is found only in the glorious truths of biblical Christianity: God created <em>ex nihilo</em>; He is both infinite and personal; we are made in His image and thus have great value in Him; Christ's death brought redemption from the consequences of the Fall (for believing individuals now and for all creation when He returns).</p> <p>There are indeed serious ecological crises in our world, but, says Dr. Francis A. Schaeffer, one of the greatest Christian thinkers of our time: "The Christian who believes the Bible should be the man who--with God's help and in the power of the Holy Spirit--is treating nature now in the direction of the way nature will be [when Christ returns].... God's calling to the Christian now, and to the Christian community, in the area of nature... is that we should exhibit a substantial healing here and now."</p> <p>A powerful Christian classic--a marvelous theological response to ecological danger signals.</p></p><p><p>Recognized internationally for his work in Christianity and culture, <strong>Francis A.

In the singular world of this novella, this young woman's everyday experiences--watching a funeral procession, fighting with her siblings, learning to read, perhaps falling in love--resonate until they have become as weighty as any national tragedy. The smallest sensations compel, the events of history only lurk at the edges--the question of Palestine, the massacre at Sabra and Shatila. In a language that feels at once natural and alienated, Shibli breaks with the traditions of modern Arabic fiction, creating a work that has been and will continue to be hailed across literatures. Here every ordinary word, ordinary action is a small stone dropped into water: of inevitable consequence. We find ourselves mesmerized one quiet ripple at a time.</p></p><p><b>Adania Shibli</b>, novelist, essayist, and playwright, has twice received the A.M. Qattan Foundation's Young Writer Award-Palestine. Her work has been translated into French, German, Italian, Hebrew, and Korean. <br><b>Paula Haydar</b> teaches at the University of Arkansas and has translated novels by Elias Khoury, Rachid al-Daif, and Sahar Khalifeh.Starred Review. Celebrated young Palestinian writer Shibli-a playwright, author and essayist now located in the UK-makes her American debut with an exquisite, powerful novella that transports readers to her West Bank homeland. In spare prose, Shibli follows an unnamed little girl, the youngest in a large Palestinian family, as she examines her world and tries to understand her place in it. Though focused on the finest details-flakes of rust against skin, the softness of grass-Shibli takes readers to the center of a family and a culture, using the same careful, dispassionate observation to report everyday events like the father&#39;s shaving as she does to depict the death of a sibling in area violence. Like a great volume of poetry, Sibli&#39;s first novel (her second is forthcoming from Clockroot) has rhythm and unexpected momentum, and cries for re-reading.</p><h2>The Complete Poodle</h2><p>Traces the history of the poodle, describes breed standards, and discusses health care, feeding, housing, training, and preparation for shows</p><p>Dahl, a longtime breeder and exhibitor of poodles and a former editor of Poodle Review, has compiled a guide for the novice owner to selecting, grooming, exhibiting, and breeding all three poodle varieties (standard, miniature, and toy). While he does provide a very informative chapter on how to buy a puppy, which would be useful for any purebred puppy buyer, the bulk of Dahl's book is geared toward the serious aspiring breeder and exhibitor. Dahl discusses the breed's standard of perfection and the elusive qualities of breed "type." He also provides detailed illustrated guides for the major show and convenience grooming styles and for maintaining coat. His recommendations on how to develop a breeding and showing kennel and his comprehensive advice on the complexities of breeding, raising, training, and exhibiting poodles should help many new to the sport get off on the right foot. A sound contribution to the literature on a deservedly popular breed; for public libraries.<br><i>Jennifer King, Monmouth Cty.

This&nbsp;new edition&nbsp;includes two additional chapters by Ian Shapiro, Dahl&#x2019;s successor as Sterling Professor of Political Science at Yale and a leading contemporary authority on democracy. One chapter deals with the prospects for democracy in light of developments since the advent of the Arab spring in 2010. The other takes up the effects of inequality and money in politics on the quality of democracy, a subject that was of increasing concern to Dahl in his final years.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The late Robert Dahl&#x2019;s <i>On Democracy</i> is <i>the</i> source for how to govern democratically. Following the methods and channeling the insight of Dahl, Ian Shapiro&#x2019;s new edition completes Dahl&#x2019;s project and is must reading for the next generation and essential re-reading for the present.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Doyle, Columbia University<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dahl&#x2019;s tersest summary of the lessons of his profoundly influential interrogation of democracy&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses.

Ian Shapiro is Sterling Professor of Political Science at Yale University, where he also serves as Henry R. Luce Director of the&nbsp;MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies."The two new chapters are extremely useful as they address in detail three compelling challenges to democracy, which Dahl had noted but not addressed at length. I also very much like the Preface as it will help my students put Dahl into a larger context and help them better understand the history of political science."&#x2014;Alana Jeydel, American River College<br>"The introduction will help readers see <i>On Democracy </i>in the context of Dahl&#x2019;s entire body of work, and will give students a sense of his importance to the field of modern political science."&#x2014;Sally Howard, Concord University<br>"The new chapters succeed in both investigating the empirical basis of certain claims in the text, and thoughtfully evaluating the future of democracy and democratization in the context of the findings.

It concentrates on the twin themes of revolution and nationalism, which often combined in the early part of the century but which increasingly became rival creeds. Going beyond traditional political and diplomatic history, the book incorporates the results of recent research on population movements, the expansion of markets, the accumulation of capital, social mobility, education, changing patterns of leisure, religious practices, and intellectual and artistic developments.<br> The work falls into three chronological sections. The first, starting in 1800 (rather than the more usual 1815) follows the build-up of the revolutionary currents which were eventually going to erupt in the `Year of Revolutions' 1848. The second, from 1850 to 1880, deals with the golden age of capitalism, the successful culmination of struggles for national unification, and the threat of anarchism. The concluding chapters look at the social and political stresses caused by socialism and national minorities, at new attempts by government to order society, imperial rivalry, and the descent into a war which was to mark the end of nineteenth-century Europe. <br> For this third edition, Dr Gildea has substantially revised the text and maps, and completely updated the bibliography. New introductory sections guide the reader through the wealth of material in each chapter. The new edition also includes a full chronology of the period, a list of leading state ministers, and family trees for all the major dynasties.<br></p><p><br>Robert Gildea is Professor of Modern French History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Merton College.<br>Review from previous edition From the first edition:<br><br>`A brilliant blend of synthesis and original insight.'<br>T.C.W.

In this collection of essays, the French scholar Jean Bottero attempts to go back to the moment which marks the very beginning of history.<br> <br> To give the reader some sense of how Mesopotamian civilization has been mediated and interpreted in its transmission through time, Bottero begins with an account of Assyriology, the discipline devoted to the ancient culture. This transmission, compounded with countless discoveries, would not have been possible without the surprising decipherment of the cuneiform writing system. Bottero also focuses on divination in the ancient world, contending that certain modes of worship in Mesopotamia, in their application of causality and proof, prefigure the "scientific mind."</p></p><p><p>Jean Bottero, a scholar of rare abilities, is Director Emeritus of Assyriology in the Department of Philology and History at the Ecole pratique des hautes etudes. Bottero's other books include Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods (1992) and a volume on ancient Mesopotamian cuisine.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Ego and Analysis of Defense</h2><p><b>The Ego and Analysis of Defense</b>, by Paul Gray, without a doubt represents a major advance in analytic technique. How therapists listen and what they do with what they hear must be the primary issues that any technical approach addresses. Paul Gray shows how technique has, until now, lagged far behind theory in addressing these and other important questions. This book is essential reading for every practicing clinician.</p><p><b>Paul Gray</b> spent his early years in South Dakota, then went on to the University of Chicago where he earned a B.A. and an M.D. At 25 he began analytic training and the practice of Psychiatry in Washington, D.C. For the past quarter of a century his scientific interests and contributions to the major journals have centered on the theory and practice of psychoanalytic technique. As a training and supervising analyst with the Baltimore-Washington Institute for Psycho-analysis he has for many years taught candidates and graduates, as well as social workers and psychiatric residents in the community. Elected twice as Councillor-at Large, his activities with the American Psychoanalytic Association also included serving on several of its Committees, and as Plenary Speaker in 1990. For over thirty years he has been a regular participant in the semi-annual work of the Center for Advanced Psychoanalytic Studies, held at Princeton, N.J.Paul Gray shows just what it takes to carry out the analysis of the ego, most of all the analysis of defense. An acknowledged master practitioner and teacher, he practices what he teaches, maximizing the patient's experiencing the flow of moments in the here-and-now clinical setting and relationship. This he does by steadily using and developing the patient's own powers of self-observation. An added benefit is an excellent section on supervision. Combining a firm allegiance to psychoanalytic tradition with expertise on the cutting edge of clinical work, Paul Gray's book meets a basic need that will be felt for as long as psychoanalysis lives; it is the need to maintain a focus 'not on the life,' as he says, but on the psyche that both makes that life and copes with it, often all too blindly. (Roy Schafer, Ph.D.)<br><br>Paul Gray challenges us to get rid of the last vestiges of our hypnotic-authoritarian roots and to refine a technique emphasizing the collaborative analytic effort to comprehend the patient's mind at work. <i>The Ego and Analysis of Defense</i> will be read with admiration for Dr. Gray's scholarship and creativity; at the end the reader will find Gray's position compelling, his argument sound. He is one of a small group of psychoanalysts who have earned the rank of master. (Arnold D. Richards M.D., editor, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Assocation)</p><h2>God Made Your Body (Pure Foundations)</h2><p>Author Jim Burns believes the key to instilling in children a healthy, values centered view of sexuality is to start the discussion early--being open and honest at every stage. The Pure Foundations series is already guiding parents of preteens and teens through potentially awkward conversations. Now two fully illustrated books--one for pre-readers and one for early readers--complete the series.<br><br>God Made Your Body provides the basic foundation that God created our bodies and wants us to honor Him with our bodies. Through engaging text and eye-catching, kid-friendly illustrations, children ages 3 to 5 will learn that boys' and girls' bodies are different--and those differences mean boys and girls can grow up to become daddies and mommies.</p><p>Laying the Foundations for Healthy Sexuality<br>An Age-Appropriate Resource for Ages 3 to 5<br><br>Children's curiosity often prompts them to ask questions you, as a parent, don't feel ready or able to answer. But it doesn't have to be that way. Dr. Jim Burns, family expert and award-winning author, offers a valuable resource for those uncomfortable--even dreaded--conversations.<br><br>With biblical, age-appropriate information and illustrations, God Made Your Body introduces children ages 3 to 5 to the basic idea that God created our bodies. Addressing topics such as how boys and girls are different, it also emphasizes how each child is unique and special to God.<br><br>Though not always easy, opening this discussion early helps you lay a solid, godly foundation in your children's lives. By reading this book together, you are giving your children the tools they will need throughout their lives to make God-honoring decisions about their bodies, their self-image, and their relationships. Don't wait until it's too late. A life of purity can begin today.Jim Burns founded the ministry of HomeWord in 1985 with the goal of bringing help and hope to struggling families.

Based on an understanding of the shapes, markings and features of a face, a therapist can discover important facts about the health and life of a patient, related to the principles of Chinese medicine. In addition to understanding how the body's internal functions can be seen on a face, readers will also learn to evaluate non-verbal expressions and assess personality from features and markings of the patient's face.<li> Clear discussions demonstrate how this technique can be used as a supplement to other diagnostic tools in Traditional Chinese Medicine.</li><li> Engaging, insightful, highly readable text is written by a well-known and experienced lecturer in the field.</li><li> Extensive illustrations give you a clear understanding of theories and techniques. </li><li> A focus on the deeper aspects of face reading and diagnosis helps readers become more conscious of their actions, reactions, and the health consequences of behavior.</li></p><p>'This lovely book is clearly written by someone who has been immersed in reading faces all her life and who spent twenty years before writing it, studying further from Chinese medical and other texts and from family members. It clearly lays out all the theories and principles of face reading, mostly relating to understanding personality ( but also in a final chapter to medical diagnosis) and illustrates these with numerous black and white and colour photographs. <br><br>This is simply the best book on face reading that we have seen, and if the subject fascinates you, you just have to get it.'<br><br>Peter Deadman, Journal of Chinese Medicine</p><h2>Interpersonal Communication: Building Connections Together</h2><p>Written in a conversational style for students living in today&#x2032;s world of ever-evolving media and new technology, this hands-on skills guide by Teri Kwal Gamble and Michael W.

The story revolves around a grim yet darkly humorous pilgrimage, as Addie Bundren's family sets out to fulfill her last wish: to be buried in her native Jefferson, Mississippi, far from the miserable backwater surroundings of her married life. Told through multiple voices, it vividly brings to life Faulkner's imaginary South, one of the great invented landscapes in all of literature, and is replete with the poignant, impoverished, violent, and hypnotically fascinating characters that were his trademark. <br><br>This edition reproduces the corrected text of As I Lay Dying as established in 1985 by Noel Polk.</p><p>Faulkner's distinctive narrative structures--the uses of multiple points of view and the inner psychological voices of the characters--in one of its most successful incarnations here in <i>As I Lay Dying</i>. In the story, the members of the Bundren family must take the body of Addie, matriarch of the family, to the town where Addie wanted to be buried. Along the way, we listen to each of the members on the macabre pilgrimage, while Faulkner heaps upon them various flavors of disaster. Contains the famous chapter completing the equation about mothers and fish--you'll see.At the heart of this 1930 novel is the Bundren family&#39;s bizarre journey to Jefferson to bury Addie, their wife and mother. Faulkner lets each family member--including Addie--and others along the way tell their private responses to Addie&#39;s life.</p><h2>Seizing the Light: A History of Photography</h2><p><i>"Its chief virtues are a succinct, mostly lucid style, a wide intellectual scope, a flood of ideas and insights at every turn, sensitivity to the technology and culture of photography, and a willingness to attend to images . . .

Alice is caught up in a bizarre chess game and encounters some rather eccentric characters&#x2014;including the argumentative Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, the nonsensical White Queen, and the quick-tempered Red Queen. The story features the poems, &#x201c;The Walrus and the Carpenter&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jabberwocky," which have become just as well known as Alice&#x2019;s adventures themselves. The award-winning artist Robert Ingpen has illustrated Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s enchanting sequel to <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> in this sumptuous volume. Full of anarchic humour, witty rhymes, and sparkling word play, it will delight new readers and devoted Alice fans alike.</p><p><p>This 1872 sequel to Lewis Carroll's beloved <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> finds the inquisitive heroine in a fantastic land where everything is reversed. Looking-glass land, a topsy-turvy world lurking just behind the mirror over Alice's mantel, is a fantastic realm of live chessmen, madcap kings and queens, strange mythological creatures, talking flowers and puddings, and rude insects.<br>Brooks and hedges divide the lush greenery of looking-glass land into a chessboard, where Alice becomes a pawn in a bizarre game of chess involving Humpty Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Lion and the Unicorn, the White Knight, and other nursery-rhyme figures. Promised a crown when she reaches the eighth square, Alice perseveres through a surreal landscape of amusing characters that pelt her with riddles and humorous semantic quibbles and regale her with memorable poetry, including the oft-quoted "Jabberwocky."</p><p></p><b>Lewis Carroll</b> was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832&#x2013;1898), born in Cheshire, England, who became a lecturer in Mathematics at Christ Church College, Oxford. In 1862, on a boating picnic, Carroll made up a story to tell a group of children, among them the eleven-year-old daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, Alice Liddell. <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> was published three years later and became a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Carroll soon began to work on another book featuring his inquisitive young heroine and based on the idea of a chess game. <i>Alice Through the Looking-Glass</i> was published in 1871. <b>Robert Ingpen</b> has designed, illustrated, and written more than 100 published works of fiction and nonfiction, among them <i>The Jungle Book </i>and the centenary edition of <i>Peter Pan and Wend</i>y. In 1986 he was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for his contribution to children's literature.</p><h2>Greek: An Intensive Course [2 volumes]</h2><p>The first edition of this extremely popular two volume Greek text has been successfully adopted in many high schools and colleges; the organization and approach used by the authors, make it an equally effective tool for those who would enjoy learning the language on their own.

Interwoven into the narrative is the dynamic influence of leader Jeff Fort, who&#x2014;despite his flamboyance and high visibility&#x2014;instilled a rigid structure and discipline that afforded the young men a refuge and a sense of purpose in an often hopeless community. Details of how the Nation procured government funding for gang-related projects during the War on Poverty era and fueled bonuses and job security for law enforcement, and how Fort, in particular, masterminded a deal for $2.5 million to commit acts of terrorism in the United States on behalf of Libya are also revealed. In examining whether the Black P Stone Nation was a group of criminals, brainwashed terrorists, victims of their circumstances, or champions of social change, this social history provides both&nbsp;an exploration of how and why gangs flourish and insight into the way in which minority crime is targeted in the community, reported in the media, and prosecuted in the courts.</p></p><p><p><b>Natalie Y.

In addition to the styling and external controls, the Df&#39;s other reference to Nikon&#39;s history is the retractable meter coupling tab, which allows the use of pre-1977 non-AI lenses. Much of what lies is beneath the Df&#39;s decidedly retro skin, however, will be quite familiar to current users of modern digital SLRs. While the &#34;D&#34; in the name stands for &#34;digital,&#34; the &#34;f&#34; stands for &#34;fusion,&#34; referring to the marriage of old and new. Despite its pretensions of being a fully manual camera, the Df also features front and rear electronic control dials in addition to the physical dials on the top-plate. The Df is built around the 16MP full frame sensor from the company&#39;s flagship D4, and uses the processor and AF system from the cheaper D610 model. The optical viewfinder is very large; the magnification is 0.70x and the coverage 100%. When a DX lens is attached to the Df, the viewfinder shows frame-lines indicating the DX image area. Most notably, and unusual for a modern DSLR, although the camera is based on a video-capable sensor, the Df cannot shoot video. This, according to the developers, is because the Nikon Df is intended to be a serious camera for people who want to produce &#34;pure&#34; photography.</p><p><b>Jon Sparks</b> is an award-winning photographer and writer specializing in landscape and outdoor photography.

Guided Readings&#x2014;in print and e-Pages&#x2014;map out the rhetorical situation and conventions of common public and academic genres, while Guided Process sections follow the decisions that 5 real students made as they worked in multiple genres and media. With 16 topic clusters and a range of readings from short visual arguments to longer, more complex pieces, the Reader gives students a wealth of sources, models, and inspiration for their own compositions.</p><p><b>Amy Braziller</b> is an English faculty member and former department chair at Red Rocks Community College.

The theme of The Ethics of Management, 7e, is that business firms today operate in a competitively- intense, technologically-complex and culturally-diverse global economy. Pressures to dodge issues and cut corners are greater than ever before. The Ethics of Management provides a very explicit three-part framework to analyze those problems by combining economic outcomes, legal requirements and ethical principles. Students will learn how to convincingly present their moral points of view to others in order to jointly serve their companies, protect their careers, and improve their societies.</p><p></p><h2>Trophic Cascade</h2><p><b>Winner of the Colorado Book Award in Poetry (2018)</b><br><br>In this fourth book in a series of award-winning survival narratives, Dungy writes positioned at a fulcrum, bringing a new life into the world even as her elders are passing on. In a time of massive environmental degradation, violence and abuse of power, a world in which we all must survive, these poems resonate within and beyond the scope of the human realms, delicately balancing between conflicting loci of attention. Dwelling between vibrancy and its opposite, Dungy writes in a single poem about a mother, a daughter, Smokin' Joe Frazier, brittle stars, giant boulders, and a dead blue whale. These poems are written in the face of despair to hold an impossible love and a commitment to hope.

Dungy's poems manifest an uneasy self-perception, but&#x2015;or I should say, and&#x2015;their source is strength and love.

Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

Focusing on the suburbs along the high-tech corridor of Route 128 around Boston, Lily Geismer challenges conventional scholarly assessments of Massachusetts exceptionalism, the decline of liberalism, and suburban politics in the wake of the rise of the New Right and the Reagan Revolution in the 1970s and 1980s. Although only a small portion of the population, knowledge professionals in Massachusetts and elsewhere have come to wield tremendous political leverage and power. By probing the possibilities and limitations of these suburban liberals, this rich and nuanced account shows that&#x2015;far from being an exception to national trends&#x2015;the suburbs of Massachusetts offer a model for understanding national political realignment and suburban politics in the second half of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>"This book is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the reinvention of American liberalism since the 1960s. <i>Don't Blame Us</i> reveals how affluent white suburban professionals moved a new set of material concerns--their own--to the center of public life. Surprising and provocative, this story deserves the widest possible discussion."<b>--Nancy MacLean, author of <i>Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace</i></b></p><p>"<i>Don't Blame Us</i> isolates a crucially important topic and confronts it from a wholly original, richly suggestive perspective. A valuable and original contribution to American political history, the book challenges the master narrative of the rise of the Right and the decline of the liberal coalition, and locates post-New Deal liberalism in particular spatial, institutional, and ideological venues."<b>--Bruce Schulman, Boston University</b></p><p>"Geismer recovers an all but forgotten chapter of suburban liberalism in America. <i>Don't Blame Us</i> is an unusually ambitious and compelling book that combines a detailed history of local politics in a way that forces a reconceptualization of broader national narratives of political development."<b>--Joseph Crespino, author of <i>Strom Thurmond's America</i> and <i>In Search of Another Country: Mississippi and the Conservative Counterrevolution</i></b></p><p>"<i>Don't Blame Us</i> is a remarkable piece of scholarship that tells an engaging and multifaceted story about suburban political activism and sensibilities.

Its reception was so ecstatic that it is credited with helping to revive interest among the Victorians in Christmas traditions, including caroling and holiday cards, as well as inciting an unexpected wave of charitable giving from Britain&#x2019;s Industrial Age robber barons.&nbsp;Originally conceived as a pamphlet against exploitative capitalism before taking its current form, it has inspired dozens of theatrical and movie adaptions, and its characters, from Scrooge to Tiny Tim, are forever inscribed in our hearts and minds.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Penguin Christmas Classics</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Give the gift of literature this Christmas.<br>&nbsp;<br>Penguin Christmas Classics honor the power of literature to keep on giving through the ages.

The Yuletide yarns of Anthony Trollope popularized throughout the British Empire and around the world the trappings of Christmas in London. <i>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&nbsp;</i>created the origin story for the presiding spirit of Christmas as we know it.&nbsp;The holiday tales of Louisa May Alcott shaped the ideal of an American Christmas. <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> brought forth some of our earliest Christmas traditions as passed down through folk tales.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Foundations in Microbiology</h2><p>Foundations in Microbiology is an allied health microbiology text with a taxonomic approach to the disease chapters.

It has inspired almost every conceivable kind of imitation and variation, and been the subject of plays, opera, cartoons, and computer games. The character of Crusoe has entered the consciousness of each succeeding generation as readers add their own interpretation to the adventures so thrillingly &#39;recorded&#39; by Defoe. Praised by eminent figures such as Coleridge, Rousseau and Wordsworth, this perennially popular book was cited by Karl Marx in Das Kapital to illustrate economic theory. However it is readers of all ages over the last 280 years who have given Robinson Crusoe its abiding position as a classic tale of adventure.</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>Mythologies (2 Volumes)</h2><p>With 395 original articles written by leading scholars, it is a remarkable encounter with the mythologies of cultures past and present&#x2014;the web of stories, traditions, rituals, practices, beliefs, divine figures, sacred objects, and great themes that define civilization.<br><br> Drawing on a breathtaking array of sources, from the history of religions to anthropology, archaeology, literature, and linguistics, the contributors define a new approach to the understanding of myth in society.<br><br> For this first English-language edition, the articles have been rearranged by region or culture. Together they comprise an exceptionally broad, stimulating introduction to the religious and mythical traditions of the world&#x2014;from the idea of death in Ancient Egypt to the ideology of nationalism in modern Europe. Greeks and Romans are here in force, naturally, but so too are the Bantu, Dinka, and Dogon of Africa and the Armenians, Mongols, and Turks of Asia.<br><br> Readers of <i>Mythologies</i> will discover a wealth of fresh primary sources on such little known traditions as those of the Vietnamese&#x2014;and bold, provocative new interpretations of well-studied traditions, such as those of classical Greece.</p><p>This is a comprehensive reference and research source that offers new ways to understand the power of myth and tradition across cultures and centuries.<b>Wendy Doniger</b> is the Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions in the Divinity School and a professor in the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Building a Bamboo Fly-Rod</h2><p><p><strong>Bamboo is a beautiful, versatile, and inexpensive material&#x2015;and the tools needed are simple and few</strong></p> Rodmaker George Maurer has built some of the finest and most innovative bamboo rods seen in a generation.

This green landscape, however, is not the work of nature. It's the work of history.<br><br>In the years after the Gold Rush, American settlers remade the California landscape, harnessing nature to their vision of the good life. Horticulturists, boosters, and civic reformers began to "improve" the bare, brown countryside, planting millions of trees to create groves, wooded suburbs, and landscaped cities. They imported the blue-green eucalypts whose tangy fragrance was thought to cure malaria. They built the lucrative "Orange Empire" on the sweet juice and thick skin of the Washington navel, an industrial fruit. They lined their streets with graceful palms to announce that they were not in the Midwest anymore.<br><br>To the north the majestic coastal redwoods inspired awe and invited exploitation. A resource in the state, the durable heartwood of these timeless giants became infrastructure, transformed by the saw teeth of American enterprise. By 1900 timber firms owned the entire redwood forest; by 1950 they had clear-cut almost all of the old-growth trees.<br><br>In time California's new landscape proved to be no paradise: the eucalypts in the Berkeley hills exploded in fire; the orange groves near Riverside froze on cold nights; Los Angeles's palms harbored rats and dropped heavy fronds on the streets below. Disease, infestation, and development all spelled decline for these nonnative evergreens. In the north, however, a new forest of second-growth redwood took root, nurtured by protective laws and sustainable harvesting. Today there are more California redwoods than there were a century ago.<br><br>Rich in character and story, <i>Trees in Paradise</i> is a dazzling narrative that offers an insightful, new perspective on the history of the Golden State and the American West.<br><br>32 pages of illustrations.</p><p>* Winner, Ray Allen Billington Prize, Organization of American Historians<br>* Winner, Charles A.

Though special deputy police commissioner for New York State since 1920, he opposed the death penalty, and he advocated the rehabilitation of criminals. He opened a psychiatric clinic to serve the mentally disturbed down-and-out of the Bowery; and he disputed the use of the &#x201c;water cure,&#x201d; a torture technique devised by the US Army to interrogate prisoners during the occupation of the Philippines in World War II. He was a star among law enforcement officials and the medical establishment, and among society&#x2019;s upper crust, too.1<br> <br>But Dr. Simon had his idiosyncrasies and prejudices. The bald, hulking doctor dabbled in phrenology. He assured his formidable audiences, including the New York Academy of Medicine and the New York State Association of Chiefs of Police, that a criminal could be identified even before he committed a crime by a drooping eyelid or a hanging corner of the mouth.2 Simon was also an expert on race. &#x201c;Negro criminals,&#x201d; he opined, were &#x201c;dishonest, shiftless, and unreliable.&#x201d;3 His 1947 lecture to the International Association of Chiefs of Police on &#x201c;Homosexualists and Sex Crimes,&#x201d; a model of bigotry and flawed logic, passed for science that lay people accepted uncritically. The &#x201c;born-male homosexualists,&#x201d; he asserted, are easy to spot by their female characteristics: their walk, body contour, voice, mannerisms, texture of skin, and also their interest in housekeeping and theatrical productions. The &#x201c;women homosexualists&#x201d; are fickle, always eager to add to their list of conquests, and are extremely jealous of the object of their lusts.<br> <br>Though Simon granted that some homosexualists live as &#x201c;decent members of society,&#x201d; many, he insisted, have psychopathic personalities, are indifferent to public opinion, and become &#x201c;predatory prostitutes.&#x201d; He extolled the state of Illinois&#x2019;s treatment of &#x201c;homosexualist psychopathic individuals&#x201d; and recommended it be adopted everywhere. In Illinois, convicted &#x201c;homosexualists&#x201d; could be held as psychiatric prisoners until they &#x201c;recovered.&#x201d; If they &#x201c;recovered,&#x201d; they were then tried for having committed sodomy, which was punishable in that state by up to ten years in prison.4<br> <br>Dr. Simon had influential counterparts all over the country, such as Dr.&nbsp;Arthur Lewis Miller, a Nebraska physician who was state health director. From that position of authority, Dr. Miller disseminated his theory about the homosexual&#x2019;s cycles of uncontrolled desire, which were as regular as women&#x2019;s menstrual cycles. &#x201c;Three or four days in each month, the homosexual&#x2019;s instinct [for moral decency] breaks down, and he is driven into abnormal fields of sexual practice.&#x201d; Because the homosexual can&#x2019;t control himself, the doctor told the Nebraska State Medical Association, science must step in. &#x201c;Large doses of sedatives or other treatment&#x201d; were what Dr.&nbsp;Miller recommended to help the homosexual &#x201c;escape from performing acts of homosexuality.&#x201d;5<br> <br>When Dr. Miller was elected to the US Congress, he brought his ideas with him to Washington. As Congressman Miller, he authored a Sexual Psychopath Law for the District of Columbia.6 The Miller Act, as it was called, passed both the House and the Senate without difficulty. It made sodomy punishable by up to twenty years in prison. It also mandated that anyone accused of sodomy (defined as either anal or oral sex) had to be examined by a psychiatric team. The psychiatrists would determine whether the accused was a &#x201c;sexual psychopath&#x201d;&#x2014;one who through &#x201c;repeated misconduct in sexual matters&#x201d; had shown himself to be unable to control his sexual impulses. If a man were picked up several times by the DC police for cruising in Lafayette Park, for instance, the psychiatric team could diagnose him to be a &#x201c;sexual psychopath,&#x201d; and he could be committed to the criminal ward of the District of Columbia&#x2019;s St. Elizabeth&#x2019;s psychiatric hospital, even before being allowed his day in court. Under section 207 of the bill, he would remain there until the superintendent of St. Elizabeth&#x2019;s &#x201c;finds that he has sufficiently recovered.&#x201d; The Senate Committee on the District of Columbia called the Miller Act a &#x201c;humane and practical approach to the problem of persons unable to control their sexual emotions.&#x201d;7<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>President Harry Truman signed Dr. Miller&#x2019;s bill into law in June 1948. Five months earlier, Alfred Kinsey&#x2019;s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male had been published. No one who was reasonably informed could have escaped knowing about Kinsey&#x2019;s book because it was reviewed in every major newspaper and magazine in the country. Kinsey&#x2019;s name became a household word. He and his team had interviewed 5,300 men, asking each of them over three hundred questions: the Kinsey Study found that 46 percent of American males admitted that as adults they&#x2019;d &#x201c;reacted&#x201d; sexually to both males and females; 37 percent admitted to having had at least one homosexual &#x201c;experience&#x201d; as an adult; 10 percent said that as adults they&#x2019;d been &#x201c;more or less exclusively homosexual&#x201d; for at least three years.8<br> <br>Even those who chose to believe that Kinsey&#x2019;s numbers were inflated had to admit the likelihood that vast numbers of the male population were having sex with other men. But, in a stunning disconnect, lawmakers and the medical doctors who influenced them preferred to insist that people who engaged in such acts comprised a tiny distinct group, different from the rest of humanity. These &#x201c;homosexuals&#x201d; were lawbreakers and loonies, and they must be controlled.9<br> CONTROLLING THE LAWBREAKERS<p></p> <br>About ten o&#x2019;clock on the evening of September 4, 1959, Thomas Ferry, a strikingly well-built young man in tight jeans and a form-fitting T-shirt, walked into Tiger&#x2019;s, a beer-and-wine bar on Los Angeles&#x2019;s Sunset Strip. The routine wasn&#x2019;t new to him; he&#x2019;d been in Tiger&#x2019;s five times in the last weeks. He sat down at the end of the long bar so that he could see the action, and he ordered a beer. Ten o&#x2019;clock was early for a Friday night, and the crowd was thin. As Ferry sipped from his glass, he idly watched a shirtless man in his twenties, eyebrows penciled and eyes mascaraed, stand at the jukebox and feed it dimes, and then walk back to his seat with an exaggerated swishing of his hips. Ferry hadn&#x2019;t taken more than a few sips of his beer before the bartender placed in front of him another full glass. The bartender nodded in the direction of a man sitting a few stools away. The man, in his thirties perhaps, was smiling at Ferry. Ferry had been in Tiger&#x2019;s no more than ten minutes, but he knew he&#x2019;d already caught his fish.<br> <br>Ferry got up and walked over to where the man was sitting. &#x201c;Thanks for the beer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d; &#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;d like to know you,&#x201d; the man said. He introduced himself as Jim Cannon and offered his hand. Ferry shook hands warmly, and then pulled a business card from a back pocket and gave it to Cannon. The card said that the affable young man was Tom Ferry, a salesman. &#x201c;Well, pleased to meet you, Tom,&#x201d; Cannon said, putting the card in his wallet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me buy you a drink now,&#x201d; Ferry said, standing close to Jim Cannon&#x2019;s bar stool.10<br> <br>Two of Jim Cannon&#x2019;s friends who&#x2019;d just come back from San Francisco walked into Tiger&#x2019;s and, spotting Cannon, came over to chat about their gay adventures up north. Ferry stood there patiently, listening. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you sit down,&#x201d; Cannon suggested, and Ferry took the stool next to him. In the dark of the bar, Cannon, still talking with his friends, put a hand on Ferry&#x2019;s knee. Ferry sat there. Cannon squeezed his thigh, stroked his pubic area, and Ferry still didn&#x2019;t move away.<br> <br>After Cannon&#x2019;s friends went off to find a table, Ferry said casually, &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s too dead in here for me. I think I&#x2019;ll leave. Do you want to go? My car&#x2019;s across the street.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, swell!&#x201d; Cannon said, flattered by the buff younger man&#x2019;s willingness. They left and crossed the street together. Officer Martin Yturralde, who was waiting in the unmarked car, got out to witness Thomas Ferry flash his officer&#x2019;s badge at James Cannon, pull out his handcuffs, and make the arrest. Officers Ferry and Yturralde deposited the stunned Cannon into the back of the car and drove him to the Hollywood police station, where he was asked to take out his wallet and show his identification. Officer Ferry plucked his &#x201c;salesman&#x201d; card from Cannon&#x2019;s wallet because he knew he&#x2019;d be using it again.11 James Cannon was charged under Penal Code 647.5: Vag-lewd, which covered vagrancy as well as lewd and lascivious conduct.<br> <br>Ferry&#x2019;s report was added to the record the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control had been building for months&#x2014;reports of dozens of visits to Tiger&#x2019;s by undercover agents and officers. After the deputy attorney general of California examined their testimonies, he affirmed the ABC&#x2019;s recommendation. The bar&#x2019;s license was revoked.12<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control had actually been created because of homosexuals. Before 1955, there was only an Alcoholic Beverage Commission, under the Board of Equalization. In 1951 the California Legislature authorized and pledged to finance a four-year study on &#x201c;Sexual Psychopath Legislation&#x201d; in twenty-three states and the District of Columbia.13 Four years later, horrified (as they&#x2019;d expected to be) by what the study told about homosexuals and their &#x201c;victims,&#x201d; the legislators passed a constitutional amendment that created a Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and added a section to the Business and Professions Code that said that a liquor license could be revoked if a place was a &#x201c;resort&#x201d; where &#x201c;sexual perverts&#x201d; congregated.14<br> <br>The newly created ABC was charged with maintaining public safety in establishments that served alcohol&#x2014;and homosexuality, the legislature and most of America agreed, was intensely injurious to the public. Undercover agents and vice squad police were sent out on fishing expeditions, to find any evidence that the ABC could use to close the doors of homosexual bars. In San Francisco, by the late 1950s, there were so many undercover officers and agents that some nights they made up 25 percent of the people in the bar. For several months in 1959, for instance, agents were sent to a small, sedate bar on Geary Street, the Criterion Lounge. According to the hearing transcript of the agents&#x2019; testimony, one evening there were sixteen patrons and four undercover officers in the bar&#x2014;each officer waiting for a patron to do something lewd to him.15<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Lesbians were less likely than homosexual men to make a sexual move on a stranger after a brief conversation, but women agents and undercover officers were sent into lesbian bars as spies.16 Almost as soon as the Alcoholic Beverage Control was established in 1955, vice squad officer Marge Gwinn was sent with another undercover policewoman, Helen Davis, to do surveillance on Pearl&#x2019;s, a lesbian bar that catered mostly to Latinas, for whom the place was like a social club. Gwinn passing for butch in boy&#x2019;s pants and short pomaded hair, and Davis passing for her femme, hit pay dirt after only a few nights. Lorinda Pereira, a young woman in a dress and high heels, plopped herself down on the lap of short-haired Dorothy Gardner, who was decked out in a man&#x2019;s shirt and fly-front trousers. Gardner petted Pereira&#x2019;s leg and then rested her hand somewhere near Pereira&#x2019;s pubic area&#x2014;and Officers Gwinn and Davis quietly summoned their Oakland Police Department colleagues for a 1:30 a.m. raid. With a nod to the raiding police, the two officers identified the two women whose behavior was &#x201c;injurious to public welfare and morals.&#x201d; Pereira and Gardner were the first to be taken out to the paddy wagon. At the station, they were charged under Penal Code 647.5, &#x201c;vag-lewds,&#x201d; and were given suspended sentences of thirty days. Their &#x201c;misconduct&#x201d; was the heart of the ABC case to revoke Pearl Kershaw&#x2019;s liquor license and shut the bar down.17<br> <br>At a time when bars were the only public place where homosexuals could congregate, the loss of any gay bar was no small thing. Yet there was almost no public protest among gay bar-goers when Pearl&#x2019;s was lost; nor when the North Coastal Area administrator of the ABC, Sidney Feinberg, declared a &#x201c;vigorous&#x201d; campaign to revoke the licenses of all gay establishments in the region. Feinberg, an imposing figure with a booming voice,18 announced publicly that he&#x2019;d put a dozen undercover agents to work, &#x201c;gathering evidence.&#x201d;19 But to protest, homosexuals would have had to admit they were part of a group called &#x201c;perverts&#x201d; and &#x201c;psychopaths.&#x201d; Everywhere, homosexual anger was tamped down by shame and fear.20<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>If you let your homosexuality show, the streets were even more unsafe than the bars. George Barrett was a police officer with New York&#x2019;s Sixteenth Precinct. &#x201c;Germs,&#x201d; &#x201c;degenerates,&#x201d; and &#x201c;perverts&#x201d; he called the homosexuals and &#x201c;other lawbreakers&#x201d; he ran into on his beat around Times Square, an area he dubbed &#x201c;the sewer.&#x201d; Barrett admitted to being &#x201c;obsessed&#x201d; with cleaning up the sewer and getting rid of the &#x201c;germs.&#x201d; His language, and his looks too, were a caricature of the hard-boiled film noir cop: &#x201c;If I can&#x2019;t get the best of a guy with punches, I&#x2019;ll kick him, and if he&#x2019;s a better kicker than I am, I&#x2019;ll go with the stick or the jack, and if I have to, I&#x2019;ll use my gun,&#x201d; he told James Mills, a reporter for Life magazine in 1965. Mills described him in a long, illustrated feature article as having eyes as cold as gun metal and a jaw as hard and square as a brick. Barrett liked the description. &#x201c;My wife says I got a mean look too,&#x201d; he boasted. Most nights, Barrett roamed the area between Forty-Third and Forty-Fifth Streets, looking to bust homosexual prostitutes and their clients. He relished his work so much that he invited Mills to come along and watch the perverts with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;These animals, I&#x2019;ll eat them up!&#x201d; he told the reporter, who shadowed him up and down the streets. Barrett pointed out a group of five women standing together in a doorway: prostitutes and heroin addicts, all of them lesbians, he snarled. On a side street off Broadway, Barrett stopped when he saw a knot of six young men, two of them in a heated altercation. &#x201c;Are you males?&#x201d; he growled, though he knew they were. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; they said, startled by the sudden appearance of a cop. &#x201c;Are you homosexual?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; they admitted. &#x201c;Well, you germs walk up this street to Broadway and get lost.

Rather than studying the rift basins as local features, ongoing work reveals that the Triassic-Jurassic rifts should be considered in a broader context that spans the entire proto-Atlantic realm. The rift province, collectively called the central Atlantic margin system, spans more than 45 degrees of paleolatitude and records over 35 million years of Earth history. The central Atlantic margin basins are of broad appeal to researchers interested in topics as diverse as extensional tectonics, the global magnetostratigraphic timescale, the evolution of early mammals, the appearance and diversification of dinosaurs, rift to drift crustal dynamics, astronomical forcing of climate, and models for the formation and occurrence of economic minerals and fossil fuel deposits. This extensive two volume work offers in-depth coverage of the North American components of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province rifts by experts in the field. <br><br>In volume 2, leading researchers give thorough reviews and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the sedimentary rocks, stratigraphic architecture, early dinosaur and reptile footprints, and vertebrae fossils of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.<br><br>The companion volume, <i>The Great Rift Valleys of Pangea in Eastern North America: Volume 1, Techtonics, Structure, and Volcanism</i>, 0-231-11162-2, covers such topics as the structural geology, tectonics, and volcanism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.

Why are barricades built of concrete, steel, and barbed wire when threats to the nation today are so often miniaturized, vaporous, clandestine, dispersed, or networked? </p><p>In <i>Walled States, Waning Sovereignty</i>, Wendy Brown considers the recent spate of wall building in contrast to the erosion of nation-state sovereignty. Drawing on classical and contemporary political theories of state sovereignty in order to understand how state power and national identity persist amid its decline, Brown considers both the need of the state for legitimacy and the popular desires that incite the contemporary building of walls. The new walls -- dividing Texas from Mexico, Israel from Palestine, South Africa from Zimbabwe -- consecrate the broken boundaries they would seem to contest and signify the ungovernability of a range of forces unleashed by globalization. Yet these same walls often amount to little more than theatrical props, frequently breached, and blur the distinction between law and lawlessness that they are intended to represent. But if today's walls fail to resolve the conflicts between globalization and national identity, they nonetheless project a stark image of sovereign power. Walls, Brown argues, address human desires for containment and protection in a world increasingly without these provisions. Walls respond to the wish for horizons even as horizons are vanquished.</p></p><p><p>Wendy Brown is Class of 1936 First Chair of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is also affiliated with the Department of Rhetoric and the Critical Theory Program. She is the author, most recently, of <i> Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire</i>, <i> Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics</i>, and <i> Politics Out of History</i>.</p><p>Brown's thesis, summarily put, is that modern-day walls are discredited markers of failing sovereignty. What is sovereignty? It is the revealed will of a political association to dispose of its own affairs. As that definition implies, it contains an irreducible element of the de facto. For Brown, sovereignty is now a ragged oriflamme, a willful but doomed exercise in self-persuasion.</p> (Glen Newey <i>London Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Medical Terminology Simplified: A Programmed Learning Approach by Body System</h2><p><ul><br> <li><strong>Programmed, frame-based learning approach</strong>&#x2014;including a <strong>free bookmark</strong> that will help students quiz themselves and study at their own pace.</li><br> <li><strong>True-to-life artwork</strong> for each body system and key pathologic conditions.</li><br> <li>A summary of <strong>major combining forms</strong> and <strong>suffixes</strong> as well as comprehensive disease, procedures, pharmacology, and medical records sections in each body system chapter.</li><br> <li><strong>Spanish translations</strong> in the Appendix for quick reference.</li><br> <li><strong>Name-specific headers</strong> that make locating material easier.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>Anthropology: Appreciating Human Diversity</h2><p>A leading name in anthropology, Conrad Philip Kottak continues to define student learning in the general anthropology course. <b>Anthropology: Appreciating Human Diversity</b> offers an up-to-date holistic introduction to general anthropology from the four-field perspective.

G. Sebald&#x2019;s first literary work, now translated into English by Michael Hamburger, explores the lives of three men connected by their restless questioning of humankind&#x2019;s place in the natural world. From the efforts of each, &#x201c;an order arises, in places beautiful and comforting, though more cruel, too, than the previous state of ignorance.&#x201d; The first figure is the great German Re-naissance painter Matthias Gr�newald. The second is the Enlightenment botanist-explorer Georg Steller, who accompanied Bering to the Arctic. The third is the author himself, who describes his wanderings among landscapes scarred by the wrecked certainties of previous ages.<br><br><b>After Nature</b> introduces many of the themes that W. G. Sebald explored in his subsequent books. A haunting vision of the waxing and waning tides of birth and devastation that lie behind and before us, it confirms the author&#x2019;s position as one of the most profound and original writers of our time.</p><p>&#x201c;A writer of almost unclassifiable originality, but whose voice we recognize as indispensable and central to our time.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;The language of <i>After Nature</i>, as conveyed in Michael Hamburger&#x2019;s flawlessly clear translation, is classically lucid. . . . It is [Sebald&#x2019;s] ability to enter diverse inner landscapes, and evoke, with an impartial empathy, entire geographies of experience, that gives [his] writing . . . its gravitas and its somber beauty.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Accessible and moving . . . a wonderful introduction to this compelling and impressive writer, even for those who insist they do not like or understand poetry.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;Here, we find the contours or outlines of his singular vision, the interconnecting, often uninterpreted threads of association that constitute a life, and meditations on his great themes of exile, memory, and loss.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;The verse retains the Sebaldian virtues of rhetorical elegance and clarity, and sits well in English, as indeed does virtually every word he wrote. . . . [<i>After Nature</i>] is a work of great power and seriousness, fully worthy to stand beside the prose works of Sebald&#x2019;s last decade.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Review of Books</i><b>W. G. Sebald</b> was born in Wertach im Allg�u, Germany, in 1944. He studied German language and literature in Freiburg, Switzerland, and Manchester. He taught at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, for thirty years, becoming professor of European literature in 1987, and from 1989 to 1994 was the first director of the British Centre for Literary Translation.

Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills&#x2015;critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail&#x2015;that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers. The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.</p><p>All the book's support materials are available for free on the Web.

And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms.

Now four centuries-old, this white racial frame encompasses not only the stereotyping, bigotry, and racist ideology emphasized in other theories of "race," but also the visual images, array of emotions, sounds of accented language, interlinking interpretations and narratives, and inclinations to discriminate that are still central to the frame&#x2019;s everyday operations. Deeply imbedded in American minds and institutions, this white racial frame has for centuries functioned as a broad worldview, one essential to the routine legitimation, scripting, and maintenance of systemic racism in the United States. Here Feagin examines how and why this white racial frame emerged in North America, how and why it has evolved socially over time, which racial groups are framed within it, how it has operated in the past and in the present for both white Americans and Americans of color, and how the latter have long responded with strategies of resistance that include enduring counter-frames.</p> <p>In this new edition, Feagin has included much new interview material and other data from recent research studies on framing issues related to white, black, Latino, and Asian Americans, and on society generally. The book also includes a new discussion of the impact of the white frame on popular culture, including on movies, video games, and television programs as well as a discussion of the white racial frame&#x2019;s significant impacts on public policymaking, immigration, the environment, health care, and crime and imprisonment issues.</p></p><p><p><strong>Joe R. Feagin</strong> is Ella C. McFadden Professor at Texas A &amp; M University.

His great achievement is precisely that&#x2015;to make us conscious of the bevy of assumptions that have legitimated, rationalized, and shaped racial oppression. Like donning a new pair of glasses, we now see even quotidian manifestations of racism in relation to the vast web of historical and institutional forces that continue to reproduce racial inequalities. We are far from transcending race as a society, but we can liberate the mind, and readers will leave this book with a grasp of elemental truths."</p> <p></p> <ul> <ul> <p></p></ul></ul> <p>-Stephen Steinberg, Urban Studies, CUNY: Queens College and Graduate center, and the author of<i> Race Relations: A Critique</i></p><i> <ul> <ul> <p></p></ul></ul></i> <p></p><i> </i><p><i>"The White Racial Frame</i> is a much needed analysis for understanding how systemic racism has continued to afflict the lives of millions of Americans of color in the twenty-first century, when supposedly the country approached a post-racial age of equality and fairness.

Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences&#x2014;biographical, historical, and literary&#x2014;to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.&nbsp;One of the greatest mystery thrillers ever written, <b>Wilkie Collins</b>&#x2019;s <i>The Woman in White</i> was a phenomenal bestseller in the 1860s, achieving even greater success than works by Dickens, Collins&#x2019;s friend and mentor. Full of surprise, intrigue, and suspense, this vastly entertaining novel continues to enthrall readers today. <br><br>The story begins with an eerie midnight encounter between artist Walter Hartright and a ghostly woman dressed all in white who seems desperate to share a dark secret. The next day Hartright, engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie and her half sister, tells his pupils about the strange events of the previous evening. Determined to learn all they can about the mysterious woman in white, the three soon find themselves drawn into a chilling vortex of crime, poison, kidnapping, and international intrigue.<br>Masterfully constructed, <i>The Woman in White</i> is dominated by two of the finest creations in all Victorian fiction&#x2014;Marion Halcombe, dark, mannish, yet irresistibly fascinating, and Count Fosco, the sinister and flamboyant &#x201c;Napoleon of Crime.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Camille Cauti</b> earned a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University. Her dissertation concerns the Catholic conversion trend among the London avant-garde of the 1890s. She has also published articles in Italian-American studies. She works in New York City as an editor and critic.</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Henry I (The English Monarchs Series)</h2><p>Henry I, son of William the Conqueror, ruled from 1100 to 1135, a time of fundamental change in the Anglo-Norman world. This long-awaited biography, written by one of the most distinguished medievalists of his generation, offers a major reassessment of Henry&#x2019;s character and reign. Challenging the dark and dated portrait of the king as brutal, greedy, and repressive, it argues instead that Henry&#x2019;s rule was based on reason and order. <br><br>C. Warren Hollister points out that Henry laid the foundations for judicial and financial institutions usually attributed to his grandson, Henry II. Royal government was centralized and systematized, leading to firm, stable, and peaceful rule for his subjects in both England and Normandy. By mid-reign Henry I was the most powerful king in Western Europe, and with astute diplomacy, an intelligence network, and strategic marriages of his children (legitimate and illegitimate), he was able to undermine the various coalitions mounted against him. Henry strove throughout his reign to solidify the Anglo-Norman dynasty, and his marriage linked the Normans to the Old English line.<br><br>Hollister vividly describes Henry&#x2019;s life and reign, places them against the political background of the time, and provides analytical studies of the king and his magnates, the royal administration, and relations between king and church. The resulting volume is one that will be welcomed by students and general readers alike.</p><p>Selected by Choice as a 2003 Outstanding Academic Title; Yale English Monarchs Series&#34;A magisterial biography.&#34;-Publishers Weekly; &#34;A work of outstanding scholarship.&#34;-Fred A.

Acclaimed for unparalleled clarity and accuracy, Wright succinctly covers traditional Western music from medieval to modern. Musical examples from each historical period are discussed within their social context, giving students a broad sense of not only the construction of a piece, but also its historical and cultural meaning. Concluding chapters discuss (1) popular music and its impact on musical globalization, and (2) music from East Asia, the Near East, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, drawing comparisons between Western and non-Western musical cultures. This chronological text actively develops listening skills in three important ways: First, <i>Listening to Music</i> includes detailed Listening Exercises throughout the book. These easy-to-grade exercises help students focus on important musical elements and episodes; by providing these exercises in the book, Craig Wright (who teaches music appreciation and uses these exercises himself) frees instructors to spend time on other aspects of class preparation. Second, a free "Introduction to Listening" CD comes packaged with each copy of the text. This CD plays all of the music and musical examples for the listening exercises in Part One, which introduces music fundamentals. Third, Active Listening Guides with streaming music and listening quizzes are available from the Schirmer Cengage Learning premium website to further challenge and test students. <br> <p><b>About This Edition</b></p> <br> <p><b>New Features</b></p> <ul> <li>Increasing the flexibility of the package, we now offer a two-CD set of core selections, a five-CD set of Western repertoire, and a separate popular/world CD.

By teaching the course every year, Wright remains in touch with what today's students need to become personally engaged in the act of listening to music.</li><br> <li>The musical repertoire selected by Craig Wright is a definitive collection of carefully chosen recordings by world-renowned artists. The complete Western repertoire is packaged in a five-CD set; a two-CD set provides a smaller, core selection of music for listening study; a separate CD provides selections from popular and non-Western music.</li><br> <li>Full coverage of women as composers, performers, and patrons of music exposes students to the significant contributions of women to the music world.

Detentions. Suspensions. Expulsions. These are the established tools of school discipline for kids who don't abide by school rules, have a hard time getting along with other kids, don't seem to respect authority, don't seem interested in learning, and are disrupting the learning of their classmates. But there's a big problem with these strategies: They are ineffective for most of the students to whom they are applied. <br> <br> It's time for a change in course. <br> <br> Here, Dr. Ross W. Greene presents an enlightened, clear-cut, and practical alternative. Relying on research from the neurosciences, Dr. Greene offers a new conceptual framework for understanding the difficulties of kids with behavioral challenges and explains why traditional discipline isn't effective at addressing these difficulties. Emphasizing the revolutionarily simple and positive notion that <i>kids do well if they can,</i> he persuasively argues that kids with behavioral challenges are not attention-seeking, manipulative, limit-testing, coercive, or unmotivated, but that they lack the skills to behave adaptively. And when adults recognize the true factors underlying difficult behavior and teach kids the skills in increments they can handle, the results are astounding: The kids overcome their obstacles; the frustration of teachers, parents, and classmates diminishes; and the well-being and learning of all students are enhanced. <br> <br> In <i>Lost at School,</i> Dr. Greene describes how his road-tested, evidence-based approach -- called Collaborative Problem Solving -- can help challenging kids at school. <br> <br> His lively, compelling narrative includes: <br> <br> � tools to identify the triggers and lagging skills underlying challenging behavior. <br> <br> � explicit guidance on how to radically improve interactions with challenging kids -- along with many examples showing how it's done. <br> <br> � dialogues, Q &amp; A's, and the story, which runs through the book, of one child and his teachers, parents, and school. <br> <br> � practical guidance for successful planning and collaboration among teachers, parents, administrations, and kids. <br> <br> Backed by years of experience and research, and written with a powerful sense of hope and achievable change, <i>Lost at School</i> gives teachers and parents the realistic strategies and information to impact the classroom experience of every challenging kid.</p><p>"I wrote <i>Lost at School</i> because a lot of educators were telling me they wanted a book on Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions that was specially geared toward the problems they face in school...and to help them persuade colleagues who were still stuck in old ways of thinking about school discipline to change their thinking and their practices. &nbsp; It's had an impact on discipline practices in many schools...just not enough of them just yet." -- Ross GreeneDr. Ross W. Greene is the author of <i>Raising Human Beings</i>, <i>Lost and Found</i>, <i>Lost at School</i>, and <i>The Explosive Child</i>. Dr. Greene was on the faculty at Harvard Medical School for over twenty years, and is now founding director of the nonprofit organization Lives in the Balance (LivesintheBalance.org), through which he disseminates the model of care&#x2014;now called <i>Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions</i>&#x2014;described in his books.

She explores the strengths of each practice, such as the clinical efficiency of diagnosis and the use of acupuncture for pain relief, improving fertility, and stress reduction in Chinese medicine and the dietary, detoxification, and spiritual guidance of Ayurveda, including the detox branch of Ayurveda known as <i>Panchakarma</i>. Moving beyond theory into practical application, she explores the Elements, known as the Five Phases and the <i>Panchamahabhutas</i>, and how they affect our well-being. She provides tools for self-assessment including a primer on tongue diagnosis and a mental, emotional, and physical constitutional questionnaire. Offering treatment and prevention strategies that draw from both disciplines, she encourages the reader to implement an integrated practice of these two systems in daily life or clinical practice. She details breathing exercises, dietary regimens, herbal recommendations, and guides for detoxification, including safe and gentle home cleanses, all rooted in the holistic synergy between Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. <br><br>Sharing case studies that highlight the interconnectedness of these approaches, Shea provides a comprehensive guide for self-healing of body, mind, and spirit and a practitioner&#x2019;s resource to cross-reference complex questions with respect to both healing traditions.</p><p>Bridgette Shea, L.Ac., MAcOM, is an acupuncturist, Chinese medicine practitioner, and Ayurveda educator whose private practice is an integration of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine.

Although these theories of life may differ in tone and focus, there are universal themes that run through both traditions&#x2019; roots. Both have a cosmology, a constitutional theory, a theory of elements, a science of taste and diet, and observational diagnostic tools like tongue and pulse diagnosis. What differs is the lens through which their originators perceived the world. That lens has colored the foundational cosmology of each system. In this chapter we will look at these underlying beliefs and cosmologies. <br><br>Both systems have emerged from a primary cosmology that applies to all life--and beyond life to everything that exists. Each system&#x2019;s cosmology applies to the birth and function of our universe, our minds, and our cells. The origin theory that underpins Chinese medicine is Taoist. Ayurveda is based largely on Sankya philosophy. Taoism is the philosophy underlying the study and practice of energy cultivation systems such as tai chi, qi gong, and Chinese martial arts. Sankhya philosophy is one of the main underlying systems of thought in India. It is the foundation for much of the yoga philosophy and practice so popular throughout India and the West today. <br><br><b>Philosophy</b> <br><br>Sankhya cosmology explains the journey of consciousness into matter--the qualities of matter, the senses, and the mind. According to Sankhya, two primordial entities manifested from their unmanifested state--Purusha, consciousness, and Prakriti, primordial matter. The interaction of these two creates a fine material called Mahat, or universal intelligence, and from Mahat emerges the stuff of individual self-awareness and differentiation, <i>ahamkara</i> or ego. This egoic energy allows for further substance to arise: the three <i>gunas</i>. These are the qualities of <i>sattva</i> (clarity), <i>rajas</i> (turbulence), and <i>tamas</i> (inertia). The three gunas correspond to our state of mind. If we are in a sattvic state, we are peaceful, calm, and clear. If in a rajasic state, we are unsettled, agitated, discontent. In a tamasic state there is lethargy, fogginess, veiled awareness. <br><br>You may be familiar with the Taoist taiji symbol. It&#x2019;s that half-white, half-black circle with a dot of white in the black half and a dot of black in the white half. The circle symbolizes the whole of existence. <br><br>The line dividing yin and yang is not static; it is wavering. This symbolizes movement. The two are constantly interacting with one another, sometimes yin dominates, sometimes yang. The friction that is created by their interaction is the qi. Qi is one thing and everything. It is lifeanimating energy or vibration. Qi is what everything is made of, how everything functions, and it takes many forms. <br><br>In Sankhya philosophy, the qi is called <i>prana</i>. Prana emerges from one of the three primary gunas. From sattva or equanimity came the quality of mind, from tamas or inertia came the body, and from the guna of rajas, or activity, prana. <br><br>All things are made of prana, even inanimate objects, but when prana circulates in its vital form a being is alive. This vital prana is said to travel along specific pathways in the body called nadis. In Chinese medicine, these pathways are called channels or meridians. In both meridians and nadis there are intersection points along the pathways that allow for multitissue communication within the body and communication between deeper parts of the body and the prana outside the body. <br><br>Qi or prana is not just form, it is not just function, it is not just vitality, it is not just the communicator between cells and individual minds and bodies. It is all of the above. Everything in existence is connected to everything else. Look at distance healing. How fascinating that a human can focus his or her intention upon someone inches or miles away and effect a healing response. Prana knows where to go. A good illustration of this is the story of one of my first Reiki experiences. <br><br><i>While working out of a storeroom in a friend&#x2019;s metaphysics shop, I encountered a woman who was interested in experiencing a Reiki healing. She was in her thirties and told me she had joint pain from systemic lupus. She sat down, and immediately my hands felt drawn to her neck.</i> <br><br><i>Now, knowing that she had systemic pain, I thought she would feel that I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing if I didn&#x2019;t do the hand positions on various places around her body. So I worked on some other areas but still felt drawn to her neck. I finally surrendered to it and brought my hands there. I had them about six inches away from her body, one facing the front of her neck and one facing the nape. I started feeling a cold breeze coming into the palms of my hands. . . the cold air intensified and it was all I could focus on. I didn&#x2019;t know what it was or what to do, so I just did what felt right and stayed in position. Within a minute or so, there was a loud CRACK! It was like the sound of a good home run. We both jumped and she said, &#x201c;I think you just cured my whiplash!&#x201d; What? She said lupus, not whiplash! It turned out she had been in an accident six months prior and seeing a chiropractor several times a month. <br></i><br>There are a few points here. One is that I didn&#x2019;t cure anything. She was in the right place at the right time and her body was given the opportunity to heal itself. Second, in Chinese medicine we talk about how cold can lodge in the body and cause pathological changes. I believe this was the case for her and that I actually felt the cold leave her body. Finally, you don&#x2019;t even need to touch someone in order to effect a healing response. The qi knows where to go and what to do, we just need to listen.</p><h2>How to Dry Foods</h2><p>Instructions for building an electric, solar, or air-flow dehydrator accompany a variety of recipes using dried foods and techniques for drying fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, nuts and seeds, meat, and fish</p><p><b>Deanna DeLong</b> is a writer, consultant, and teacher who specializes in food dehydration.

Philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists, theologians, and lawyers have long debated the existence of free will versus determinism. In this book Daniel Wegner offers a novel understanding of the issue. Like actions, he argues, the feeling of conscious will is created by the mind and brain. Yet if psychological and neural mechanisms are responsible for all human behavior, how could we have conscious will? The feeling of conscious will, Wegner shows, helps us to appreciate and remember our authorship of the things our minds and bodies do. Yes, we feel that we consciously will our actions, Wegner says, but at the same time, our actions happen to us. Although conscious will is an illusion, it serves as a guide to understanding ourselves and to developing a sense of responsibility and morality.</p><p>Approaching conscious will as a topic of psychological study, Wegner examines the issue from a variety of angles. He looks at illusions of the will&#x2015;those cases where people feel that they are willing an act that they are not doing or, conversely, are not willing an act that they in fact are doing. He explores conscious will in hypnosis, Ouija board spelling, automatic writing, and facilitated communication, as well as in such phenomena as spirit possession, dissociative identity disorder, and trance channeling. The result is a book that sidesteps endless debates to focus, more fruitfully, on the impact on our lives of the illusion of conscious will.</p></p><p>The late Daniel M. Wegner was Professor of Psychology at Harvard University.<p>Wegner has written a devishly clever, witty, and thorough book. He brings all the pieces together to tackle the problem of free will. This book will serve as the foundation for an untold number of hot debates on who is in charge of our personal destinies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael S. Gazzaniga</b>, Program in Cognitive Neuroscience, Dartmouth College<br><br><p>Philosophers have argues for centuries about the existence of free will. In this exciting book Daniel M. Wegner presents the facts about our experience of controlling our own actions. He persuasively argues that our experience of will is an illusion, but that this illusions is crucial for our concepts of morality and personal responsibility. This book should be read by anyone with an interest in how the mind works.</p>&#x2015;<b>Christopher Frith</b>, Wellcome Department of Imaging Science, Institute of Neurology, University College London<br><br><p>Daniel Wegner is our foremost modern investigator of illusions of conscious agency&#x2015;our tendency to believe that we really have more control over our own actions and thoughts than we do. In this book, Wegner boldly pursues the claim that our sense of conscious agency is ALWAYS imaginary. His arguments are based on clever experiments and deep analysis of the issues. This book will stand as a challenge to anyone trying to understand the nature of voluntary thought and action.</p>&#x2015;<b>Bernard J. Baars</b>, Senior Fellow in Theoretical Neurobiology, The Neurosciences Institute<br><br><p>Wegner presents diverse, persuasive, and entertaining evidence for his thesis that the experience of conscious will is an illusion. The book is a profound treatise on a central issue in psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gordon H. Bower</b>, Professor of Psychology, Stanford University<br><br><p>Wegner may well have made a historic breakthrough in the age-old, nettlesome problem of 'free will'&#x2015;namely, conceptualizing it as an act of causal attribution. His recounting of the history of the issue is rich with fascinating examples and illustrations. This sets us up for what may be the first experimental approach to this nettlesome philosophical problem. Because we know a lot about how people make causal attributions, we may suddenly and for the first time, thanks to Wegner's analysis, know a lot about why people believe so strongly that they have free will. Wegner shows that by manipulating the variables underlying these attributions, one changes the feeling of having acted or thought freely. This is nothing short of 'experimental philosophy' in its application of cognitive scientific principles and methods to previously intractable issues in the philosophy of mind.</p>&#x2015;<b>John A.

In it, Professor Shklar examines Rousseau&#39;s central concern: given that modern civilisation is intolerable and a return to the state of nature impossible, how is man to arrange his existence in society? Shklar organises the study around Rousseau&#39;s two conceptions of Utopia: the Spartan city and the autonomous family group. She emphasises the importance for Rousseau of psychological factors and shows how, when mediated through his images of authority and use of metaphor, they bring him to his notorious view that man is &#39;everywhere in chains&#39;. In Shklar&#39;s view, Rousseau&#39;s conclusion is almost equally pessimistic: the chances are very remote that we can overcome the psychological obstacles to become both men and citizens.</p><p>This book, first published in 1969, is widely regarded as one of the best studies of Rousseau&#39;s thought in any language.

Yet before he knew it, his distain for Violet was blossoming into desire. But Jeff feared that love wasn&#39;t enough to help him put his past behind him--or to convince a proper lady that she could find happiness as the newest bride in the rowdy Randolph clan. Original.</p><p>When Jeff Randolph goes to the Wolfe School to check up on his mischievous nieces, he meets his match in the housemother, Violet Goodwin. From the moment they are thrown together, they clash-- and Jeff delights in flustering her. She insists he return in two weeks so she can report on his nieces' progress and Jeff does as she asks, grumbling all the while that he has a bank to run and can't waste his time. When he barges in on Violet, he finds himself under quarantine confined with a bunch of girls-- and Violet. Even after the quarantine is over, circumstances keep bringing them together and Jeff is forced to admit to himself that he has feelings for Violet.

Then Jeff-- owner of the biggest bank in Denver-- joins them and Violet's life turns upside down. She can't believe the way she fantasizes about Jeff, but it's hard to deny the man's physique is impressive. She hardly notices he's missing an arm-- but he won't let anyone forget that he's not whole, least of all a Yankee woman. Their attraction to each other is strong, but they are on opposite sides of the fence when it comes to their opinions about the Civil War. And Jeff seems to have these ridiculous ideas about women-- he thinks only a Southern woman could make a good wife! But even with all his faults, Violet can't help losing her heart to Jeff.

He is director of the Doctoral Program in Urban and Public Affairs and director of the Center for Policy Research and Evaluation. For the past ten years, he has served as editor of the <i>Journal of Urban Affairs.</i>"Neighborhood succession," academics call it; ex-residents simply say their community "changed." What both groups are describing is an all-white area that became, more or less quickly, an all-black area. Cummings--a University of Louisville urban policy and sociology professor who has edited the <i>Journal of Urban Affairs</i> for 10 years--became involved with "Rosedale" (in the Dallas^-Fort Worth region) in the mid-1970s. Studying "institutional, cultural, and psychological changes that accompanied racial transition," he explores "how various public policies contributed to Rosedale's decline" and seeks to identify "new policies . . . to better enable cities to preserve, protect and revitalize their neighborhoods." Because marginalized groups were most vulnerable to Rosedale's institutional breakdown, Cummings focuses particular attention on old and young: "For the white elderly, the ghettoization of Rosedale produced fear, isolation, and withdrawal. For adolescents, it produced rage, hostility, and violence." Preventing future Rosedales, Cummings maintains, will require a serious attack on both racism and crime, as well as early action to strengthen community institutions. Thoughtful analysis of a continuing problem. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution</h2><p>The cities of eighteenth-century America packed together tens of thousands of colonists, who met each other in back rooms and plotted political tactics, debated the issues of the day in taverns, and mingled together on the wharves or in the streets. In this fascinating work, historian Benjamin L. Carp shows how these various urban meeting places provided the tinder and spark for the American Revolution.<br> Carp focuses closely on political activity in colonial America's five most populous cities--in particular, he examines Boston's waterfront community, New York tavern-goers, Newport congregations, Charleston's elite patriarchy, and the common people who gathered outside Philadelphia's State House. He shows how--because of their tight concentrations of people and diverse mixture of inhabitants--the largest cities offered fertile ground for political consciousness, political persuasion, and political action. The book traces how everyday interactions in taverns, wharves, and elsewhere slowly developed into more serious political activity. Ultimately, the residents of cities became the first to voice their discontent. Merchants began meeting to discuss the repercussions of new laws, printers fired up provocative pamphlets, and protesters took to the streets. Indeed, the cities became the flashpoints for legislative protests, committee meetings, massive outdoor gatherings, newspaper harangues, boycotts, customs evasion, violence and riots--all of which laid the groundwork for war. <br> Ranging from 1740 to 1780, this groundbreaking work contributes significantly to our understanding of the American Revolution. By focusing on some of the most pivotal events of the eighteenth century as they unfolded in the most dynamic places in America, this book illuminates how city dwellers joined in various forms of political activity that helped make the Revolution possible.<br></p><p><br><strong>Benjamin L.

For a long time, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was an exception: nearly three-quarters of people who grew up Mormon stayed that way into adulthood. In <em>The Next Mormons</em>, Jana Riess demonstrates that things are starting to change.<br><br>Drawing on a large-scale national study of four generations of current and former Mormons as well as dozens of in-depth personal interviews, Riess explores the religious beliefs and behaviors of young adult Mormons, finding that while their levels of belief remain strong, their institutional loyalties are less certain than their parents' and grandparents'. For a growing number of Millennials, the tensions between the Church's conservative ideals and their generation's commitment to individualism and pluralism prove too high, causing them to leave the faith-often experiencing deep personal anguish in the process. Those who remain within the fold are attempting to carefully balance the Church's strong emphasis on the traditional family with their generation's more inclusive definition that celebrates same-sex couples and women's equality. Mormon families are changing too. More Mormons are remaining single, parents are having fewer children, and more women are working outside the home than a generation ago.<br><br><em>The Next Mormons</em> offers a portrait of a generation navigating between traditional religion and a rapidly changing culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jana Riess </strong>is a senior columnist for Religion News Service and the author or co-author of many books, including <em>Mormonism and American Politics</em>, <em>Flunking Sainthood</em>, and <em>The Prayer Wheel: Rediscovering Prayer with an Ancient Spiritual Practice</em>.

The numbers are impressive. The prose engaging. The analytical insights profound. Although no one can predict with any certainty what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will look like a quarter century from now, this study offers a layered portrait of the contemporary church and a gentle reminder that past does not always predict the future." --Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, Author of <em>A House Full of Females: Plural Marriage and Women's Rights in Early Mormonism, 1835-1870</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Next Mormons</em> is a tour de force, replacing folklore with fact. If you are a practicing Mormon, read this book for a peek into the rising generation within the LDS Church. If you are an LDS leader, read this book to understand the challenges that are on the Church's horizon. If you are a former Mormon, read this book to see how your story lines up with those of others. If you are not LDS yourself, read this book to understand one of America's most fascinating religious groups.

Young librarians and seasoned LIS professionals alike are experiencing increasing pressure to adjust to new economic, societal, and technological demands amidst the often-dire rhetoric currently surrounding the future of our institutions. In this stirring manifesto, public intellectual, librarian, and philosopher Gorman addresses head on the existential panic among library professionals caused by the radical shift in how libraries are viewed. He reconnects readers with the core values that continue to inspire generations of library professionals and scholars while making the case that these values are doubly crucial to hold on to in the brave new shifting world of librarianship. Destined to become another classic of library literature, this book explores such contemporary issues as<ul><li>The growing emphasis of the library as a cultural institution, placing libraries within their cultural context as gathering places for learning, access to information, and community</li><li>The impact of technological innovations on core values such as access and stewardship</li><li>Library places and spaces of the future</li><li>How the mass digitization of books, archives, and other materials affects the purpose and function of libraries</li><li>Intellectual freedom and privacy in the era of the PATRIOT Act, Wikileaks, and Edward Snowden</li><li>The role of libraries as both champions and facilitators of social justice</li></ul>Inspirational yet clear-sighted, Gorman emphatically reaffirms the importance of libraries and librarians while proposing a path for future survival and growth.</p><p><b>Michael Gorman</b>, the former dean of library services at the Henry Madden Library, California State University, Fresno, served as president of the American Library Association in 2005 2006.

Instead of funding rehabilitation programs, Hoffman contends, the government mainly engages in "propaganda ploys" that neither help nor educate. Discussing misconceptions about urine testing and apparent violations of constitutional rights, he provides up-to-date information on the reliability of testing procedures and points out how lab errors are made. He challenges "bladder cops," takes readers on a field trip through a urinanalysis lab and instructs in how to beat the test. While Hoffman holds attention throughout with puns ("mind over bladder"), anecdotes and satirical writing ("golden showers come your way"), it is the extensive, in-depth research and a barrage of facts and figures that make this the definitive guide to the current drug-testing environment. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.One's initial reaction may be to dismiss Hoffman's latest j'accuse as more establishment-bashing by the Peck's Bad Boy of the left. But beyond the arch title and cutesy phrases (e.g., "bladder spies"), the book raises legitimateand disturbingquestions about the rush to drug testing in the United States. Specifically, Hoffman provides concrete and sometimes detailed documentation to support his contention that such testing is scientifically unreliable and constitutionally indefensible.

In particular, the book explores a crucial tension at the heart of the &#x201c;war on drugs&#x201d;: despite the violence and suffering brought on by drug cartels, for the rural poor in Mexico&#x2019;s north, narcotrafficking offers one of the few paths to upward mobility and is a powerful source of cultural meanings and local prestige.<br> <br> In the borderlands, traces of the drug trade are everywhere: from gang violence in cities to drug addiction in rural villages, from the vibrant folklore popularized in the narco-corridos of Norte�a music to the icon of Jes�s Malverde, the &#x201c;patron saint&#x201d; of narcos, tucked beneath the shirts of local people. In<i> When I Wear My Alligator Boots, </i>the author explores the everyday reality of the drug trade by living alongside its low-level workers, who live at the edges of the violence generated by the militarization of the war on drugs. Rather than telling the story of the powerful cartel leaders, the book focuses on the women who occasionally make their sandwiches, the low-level businessmen who launder their money, the addicts who consume their products, the mules who carry their money and drugs across borders, and the men and women who serve out prison sentences when their bosses' operations go awry.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>This book is my second sole-authored work focusing on the lives of men and women living in northern Mexico.

In selections that range from fiction to scientific speculations about thinking machines, artificial intelligence, and the nature of the brain, Hofstadter and Dennett present a variety of conflicting visions of the self and the soul as explored through the writings of some of the twentieth century&#39;s most renowned thinkers.</p><p>Ever wondered who you are? Who you <i>really</i> are? This collection of writings and reflections by some of today's most notable thinkers is designed to enliven this most central, and most baffling, question in the philosophy of mind. In some ways, the questions posed and bantered about in this book are at the heart of all philosophical reasoning. They are the ultimate questions about the self. <i>The Mind's I</i> contains an astonishing variety of approaches to answering the question, "Who am I?" Between the covers of this book one encounters the literary erudition of Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges alongside the analytic rigor of John Searle. There are sophisticated metaphorical pieces (such as "The Princess Ineffabelle" by Polish philosopher and writer Stanislaw Lem), intriguing dialogues (like Raymond Smullyan's "Is God a Taoist?"), and serious but engaging philosophical essays from a host of thinkers (see Thomas Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"). <p> Editors Hofstadter and Dennett--leading lights in the study of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind--follow each selection with a short reflection designed to elaborate on their main themes. <i>The Mind's I</i> admirably broadens their fields to a more general audience. The book's essays are grouped into six categories, each successively raising the philosophical stakes by introducing new levels of complexity. Ultimately, one confronts some of the thorniest questions in modern philosophy here, such as the nature of free will, our place in the metaphysical world, and the possibility of genuine artificial intelligence. The book closes with a playful and perplexing piece by Robert Nozick, an adequate summation to <i>The Mind's I</i>. He writes, "Perhaps God has not decided yet whether he has created, in this world, a fictional world or a real one.... Which decision do you hope for?" <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>"Brilliant, shattering, mind-jolting, <i>The Mind's I</i> is a searching, probing nook--a cosmic journey of the mind--that goes deeply into the problem of self and self-consciousness as anything written in our time. From verbalizing chimpanzees to scientific speculations involving machines with souls, from the mesmerizing, maze-like fiction of Borges to the tantalizing, dreamlike fiction of Lem and Princess Ineffable, her circuits glowing read and gold, <i>The Mind's I </i> opens the mind to the Black Box of fantasy, to the windfalls of reflection, to new dimensions of exciting possibilities.<p>"Ever since David Hume declared in the 18th century that the Self is only a heap of perceptions, the poor Ego has been in a shaky conditions indeed...Mind and consciousness becomes dispensable items in our accounts of reality, ghosts in the bodily machine...Yet there are indications here and there that the tide may be tuming...and the appearance of <i>The Mind's I</i>, edited by Douglas R. Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett, seems a welcome sign of change."--William Barrett, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Holt Literature and Language Arts, Third Course: Mastering the California Standards</h2><p>2003 Holt Literature &amp; Language Arts Third Course *Mastering the California Standards Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking (CA)(H) by Kylene Beers, Lee Odell, Robert Anderson, John Malcolm Brinnin, Flo Ota De Lange, Sheri Henderson, Madeline Travers Hovland, John Leggett, David Adams Leeming, Mara Rockliff, &amp; Diane Tasca ***ISBN-13: 9780030564949 ***Pages: 1120</p><p></p><h2>Participation and Democratic Theory</h2><p>Shows that current elitist theories are based on an inadequate understanding of the early writings of democratic theory and that much sociological evidence has been ignored.</p><p>Carole Pateman is Professor of Political Science at UCLA and Honorary Professor in the School of European Studies at Cardiff University. Her publications include Participation and Democratic Theory (1970), The Problem of Political Obligation, 2nd edition (1985), and The Sexual Contract (1988).'This is a very important book ... a lucid, intelligent and direct challenge to the presuppositions of most American and West European sociology and political science. All social science, implicitly or explicitly, in its choice of topic and its mode of treatment, bears on the kind of society that the social scientists consider possible. By accepting a caricatured 'classical doctrine of democracy' or otherwise ignoring the somewhat diverse reasoning of Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Cole and others most contemporary social science simply presumes the impossibility of any form of social organization based on genuine rule by the people. Pateman attempts to resurrect the arguments of the 'classical' theorists and to examine them in the light of empirical evidence on political socialization and workers' self-management.' The Antioch Review<br><br>' ... Pateman makes a valuable contribution to the discussion of citizen participation ... with abundant and challenging interpretations.' Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science<br><br>' ...

The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard.

Dubbed &#34;Edgar Allan Poe with a camera,&#34; Laughlin and his haunting images capture -- like nothing before or since -- the weathered elegance and dreamy decadence of Louisianas buildings, streets, and cemeteries.� After experimenting with photography in the early 1930s, Laughlin devoted himself to the medium in 1935 and had his first showing a year later. In 1948 his book on Louisiana&#39;s plantation architecture, Ghosts Along the Mississippi, vaulted him into the pantheon of great American photographers. He continued photographing actively until 1967, and lectured and wrote until his death in 1985. Over the course of his lengthy career, Laughlin produced more than 17,000 negatives and a large collection of writings on the art of photography. This stunning volume brings together 65 of Laughlin&#39;s characteristic images, both classic and unpublished -- an eerie gallery of French quarter facades and ironwork, funerary sculpture, Spanish moss, and other details that summon up Louisiana gothic. Accompanied by selections from Laughlin&#39;s various writings and letters, as well as essays by eight distinguished writersJon Kukla, John H. Lawrence, Andrei Codrescu, Ellen Gilchrist, Shirley Ann Grau, Jonathan Williams, Albert Belisle Davis, and John Wood --- Haunter of Ruins is the only book currently available on this incomparable American original. Haunter of Ruins was chosen as a winner in the General Trade Illustrated Book Category by Bookbuilders of Boston.</p><p>Haunter of Ruins: The Photography of Clarence John Laughlin has been compiled by The Historic New Orleans Collection, chosen by Laughlin as the archive for his photographs and writings. A traveling exhibition sponsored by The Historic New Orleans Collection accompanies this publication. Haunter of Ruins includes introductions by Jon Kukla, former Director of The Historic New Orleans Collection, and by John H. Lawrence, Director of Museum Programs at The Historic New Orleans Collection. Andrei Codrescu is a National Public Radio commentator and the author of Road Scholar and Blood Countess. Ellen Gilchrist is the author of fourteen books, including the National Book Award -- winning Victory Over Japan and her most recent novel, Sarah Conley. Shirley Ann Grau is the author of Roadwalkers, the Pulitzer-Prize -- winning The Keepers of the House, and other novels. Jonathan Williams is the author of An Ear in Bartram&#39;s Tree, Eight Days in Eire, and other books of poetry. Albert Belisle Davis is the author of the novels Leechtime and Marquis at Bay. Poet John Wood is the author of In Primary Light and The Gates of the Elect Kingdom as well as a study of daguerreotype photography....Laughlin had a taste for decay and for the surreal, both of which are amply documented in this selection. Many of these photos are set in and around New Orleans, where he spent most of his life. Laughlin hated what he called the " 'soft focus' approach...of balcony and courtyard scenes by the arty professional French Quarter photographers"; his New Orleans is a city of sepulchers and shadows. --The Washington Post<br><br>Rarely does a new book of photographs offer much insight into the growth of American photography as fine art. Rarer still is the book which presents the work of a little-known photographer. A new collection of Clarence John Laughlin's (1905-1985) photographs does a little of both. In the process, it reconfirms the native Louisianian's place in a pantheon of Southern photographers which includes such notables as William Christenberry, Ralph Eugene Meatyard, William Eggleston, Sally Mann, Jerry N. Uelsmann and Lee Friedlander. Like Laughlin, these artists address subjects which may or may not be distinctively Southern in a manner which seems to be so. Many of the images in Haunter of Ruins reflect what historian Robert A. Sobieszek has identified as "a pronounced engagement with the magical and mysterious in American Southern Photography of this century." Southern artists, it seems, express universal images of faith, death, decay, loss, melancholic nostalgia and attendant emotions with a richness and depth unique to the region. Laughlin's work is no exception, but it is unique in that it predates by decades the mature work of the photographers listed above. Like Meatyard, but a full decade before Meatyar's brooding mid-century meditations on identity and ecay, Laughlin populated his studies of ruined architecture with shrouded and masked figures. Like Uelsmann, but again decades before Uelsmann defined his signature style of surreal composite images, Laughlin staged elaborate, allegorical double exposures. Also, he developed a "symbolic use of the camera," which surrealist photographer Man Ray identified as unique in American photography. Although Man Ray's assessment appears in Haunter of Ruins briefly and without further explanation, it hints at the importance of Laughlin's work and raises significant questions about the photographer's contribution to the medium. Some of those questions are indirectly answered by the book's excellent reproductions of images representing Laughlin's many photographic groups, discrete series of images often presenting mystical themes. As a mixed blessing, the book's six essays do not address Laughlin's legacy as explicitly as an art critic or historian might. Thus they do not answer many of the questions raised by the images. In fact, only two of the essayists, editors Jon Kukla and John H. Lawrence, are art historians. The balance is composed of literary figures Andrei Codrescu, Ellen Gilchrist, Shirley Ann Grau, John Wood, Albert Belisle Davis and Johnathan Williams. The book's literary emphasis is both intentional and appropriate, as the written word, from literature to simple correspondence, was one of Laughlin's passions. He often alluded to literary themes or even to specific works in his photography...Of these authors, Gilchrist, Williams and Wood most directly address the photographer's work. Codrescu, a Romanian migr well known to National Public Radio fans, offers an outsider's observation of Laughlin's architecture. Grau's brief essay does not refer to Laughlin at all, but reflects some of the haunted sense-memory of his work. Likewise, Davis's "Cajun Tour" of a New Orleans cemetery is a lighthearted reference to a favorite Laughlin subject...As new generations of Southern photographers struggle to understand their work in the context of the region's rich artistic traditions, Haunter of Ruins will remind them of one of their most interesting and underrated progenitors. Non-photographers may find that the book deepens their understanding of how writing and the visual arts inform and inspire each other. From either perspective, Haunter of Ruins is an eccentric, rare and truly valuable work. --University of Missouri Press<br><br>When I first saw Clarence John Laughlin's black-and-white visions of a haunted New Orleans, I was a callow youth who knew nothing firsthand of spirits and pain. My first thought was---gee, these are rather silly, aren't they? Just a bunch of old, falling-down buildings, some women wrapped up in gauze wearing masks and the occasional art-student odd angle. Yet I was also struck somehow by the fact that, though my mind could dismiss these pictures, my heart was nonetheless engaged by something more mysterious: a profound respect for any artist free enough to produce something so superficially dopey, and yet give it so much heart. Now that I'm older, wiser/sadder and have made the personal acquaintance of some ghosts of my own, I find the way-out-there dopiness of the "Ghosts Along the Mississippi" series an absolute treat, a feast of odd and wonderful passion. And, it seems such passion was what this artist was all about. In his introduction, Jon Kukla writes that "Laughlin's friends playfully suggest challenging the authenticity of a purported Laughlin photograph if it lacks the imprint of one of Clarence John Laughin's shirt buttons pressed into its surface. Before he relinquished a photograph to the gaze of his visitor," the story continues, "it was Laughlin's custom to clasp the print to his chest while exhorting the prospective viewer to a full anticipation of its merits." What a sweet way to send a picture out into the world. But Laughlin's images themselves are not sweet; they're very, very sad. He clearly wanted to disappear into the falling-down, ghost-ridden world he created on film. As Kukla says, he "found it profoundly disturbing that humanity was being 'shoved onto a plane on which the screw, the gear, and the girder reign.' " It is this palpable, almost visible sadness and sense of loss, I think, which touches the fans of Laughlin's work. For a confirmed Laughlin fan or a newbie, this retrospective book offers plenty to chew on. With excellent reproductions from 6 of the 23 photographic series Laughlin (who died in 1985) produced, it also features excerpts from his texts and letters as captions (he was also a fanatically productive writer) and interesting analysis and background. --Photo District News</p><h2>Reading the Landscape of America</h2><p>In this natural history classic, the author takes the reader on field trips to landscapes across America, both domesticated and wild. She shows how to read the stories written in the land, interpreting the clues laid down by history, culture, and natural forces. A renowned teacher, writer and conservationist in her native Midwest, Watts studied with Henry Cowles, the pioneering American ecologist. She was the first to explain his theories of plant succesion to the general public. Her graceful, witty essays, with charming illustrations by the author, are still relevant and engaging today, as she invites us to see the world around us with fresh eyes.</p><p>A classic in landscape interpretation, remarkably timely. Unexcelled in the blending of landscape ecology and lived experience on landscapes. -- <i>Int'l Society for Environmental Ethics Newsletter, Summer 1999</i><br><br>A fantastic book. Great for understanding the Indiana Dunes and the north woods of Wisconsin, for example. -- <i>Weedpatch Gazette, Spring 1999</i><br><br>May Theilgaard Watts' classic, work, Reading the Landscape of America, is an excellent landscape guidebook with a near perfect blend of natural and cultural history. -- <i>Arnold Berleant, A.

It shows in Reading the Landscape, a beautifully written book used for decades by educators. -- <i>Chicago Wilderness Magazine, Winter 1999</i><br><br>The interpretive prototype of all landscape-level natural histories. It opened my eyes to a whole new way of seeing. -- <i>Tom Wessels, ecologist, in Stonecrop, Winter 1997</i><br><br>Watts' chapter on the Prairie Plowing Match is a classic work of landscape study. -- <i>Sonia Simone, Whole Earth Review</i><br><br>Watts' essays constitute the near perfect guidebook for the appreciation of the rural landscape. -- <i>Allen Carlson, Aesthetics and the Environment, 2000</i><br><br>This is a classic of the quality and genre to rank with Aldo Leopold's <i>Sand County Almanac</i>. . . Watts brings to the task (of ecology) an artist's eye and a story teller's way with words, to help the non-biologist better understand the world about him. --Philip B.

In Executive Coaching with Backbone and Heart, Mary Beth O'Neill outlines the dynamic approach to coaching leaders that she's developed over the course of a twenty-year career. Her unique perspective and sage advice, backed by a specific four-phase methodology, gives you the means to successfully manage the coach-client relationship and effect dramatic changes that ensure the business outcomes leaders' want. It's a one-of-a-kind guide for executive coaches--both aspiring and established--that fills a long-standing gap in coaching literature.<br> <br> To read the preface from this book, click here.</p><p>Coaching high-powered executives requires something special, something extra. Executive coaches must be more than instructors; they must become partners whose emotional investment in business outcomes equals that of their clients. They must have the strength and courage to face an organizational leader in a time of crisis and speak the unvarnished truth. They have to be a force to be reckoned with. They have to have backbone and heart.<br> Mary Beth O'Neill has backbone and heart, and she's used it to help executives become better leaders and make better business decisions for more than twenty years. In this book, she shares the secrets of her success as she details the techniques she's developed over the course of her exceptional career.<br> O'Neill knows first-hand that executive coaching is about self-management, about learning how to be with leaders so you can seize those critical moments when they are most open to learning. She focuses on the need for coaches to build their own signature presence with clients and outlines four conditions that promote such a presence.<br> The author also teaches coaches how to deal with clients in terms of the "force fields" they create and react to; that is, the political and emotional climates within organizations that can ensnare both executive and coach and make for faulty decision making. In so doing, O'Neill introduces an important new systems approach to executive coaching.<br> O'Neill reinforces her observations on coach self-management and her systems perspective with a sound four-phase methodology for implementing both, a methodology that covers contracting, planning, live action intervening, and debriefing. She also addresses special applications such as how to guide conversations that establish coaching relationships and how a coach can help executives coach others.MARY BETH O&#39;NEILL is a senior consultant for LIOS Consulting Corporation at the Leadership Institute of Seattle at Bastyr University.

While social media has changed public relations, research fundamentals have stayed the same. Stacks takes difficult theoretical and statistical concepts and makes them easy to understand, engaging readers through current, practical, and relevant examples. This primer can be used in nearly every communication or business discipline, and is a 'must have' for anyone practicing or learning about public relations."--Tina McCorkindale, PhD, Department of Communication, Appalachian State University <p>"Many consider Stacks to be the world's leading expert on public relations research methodologies. The second edition of this superb book should be required reading for students and practitioners who want to help our field move away from the archaic, outputs-focused, one-way communication that is publicity and press-agentry, and toward strategic, outcomes-focused, two-way communication."--Donald K.

DiStaso, PhD, College of Communications, The Pennsylvania State University</p> <p>"Stacks provides an informed, in-depth examination of research in the context of public relations. Since research methods are not always favorite topics among practitioners and students, understanding the critical role of research in best practices provides the necessary motivation to delve deep into the subject matter. The chapter on ethical concerns in public relations research is a much-needed contribution."--David M. Dozier, PhD, School of Journalism and Media Studies, San Diego State University<br><br>"Stacks has created the central repository of essential knowledge about why and how to conduct research that every public relations professional needs. Grounded in the fundamentals of communications theory, the book not only covers technical research skills, but also shows how to apply research to improve the day-to-day practice of public relations. This clear and practical book should become a standard reference on the desk of every public relations professional and should be required reading in every introductory course in the field."--David Michaelson, PhD, President, Echo Research, Inc., New York</p><br><br>"While designed primarily for the classroom, where it will be welcomed by students and faculty alike. Dr. Stacks' book promises to be the reference of choice for legions of practitioners who studied history, political science or anthropology in college. Why? Because the author has stripped away the gobbledygook of academic research&#x2014;to the extent that's possible&#x2014;and created a user-friendly overview of the subject that most practitioners should be able to digest in a long weekend....The Primer of Public Relations Research should be a part of every practitioner's library."

Thoreau, 26)</h2><p><p>One of the most influential and compelling books in American literature, <i>Walden</i> is a vivid account of the years that Henry D. Thoreau spent alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. This edition--introduced by noted American writer John Updike--celebrates the perennial importance of a classic work, originally published in 1854. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces from the lively "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For" and "Brute Neighbors" to the serene "Reading" and "The Pond in the Winter." Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden--as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows.</p><br><p> This is the authoritative text of <i>Walden</i> and the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind.

Twelve Year a <i>Whore</i>, Five times a <i>Wife</i> (whereof once to her own Brother), Twelve Year a <i>Thief</i>, Eight Year a Transported <i>Felon</i> in <i>Virginia</i>, at last grew <i>Rich</i>, liv'd <i>Honest</i>, and died a <i>Penitent</i>."<br>Daniel Defoe's roguish heroine tells the scandalous facts of her adventurous life with such simple and straightforward sincerity and with such a wealth of intimate detail that the reader is soon convinced that Moll must, indeed, be an authentic person.<br>Having been imprisoned for political offenses and having experienced severe economic losses in his own life, Defoe demonstrates early on in this novel how circumstances and a fear of poverty can drive one into a life of crime. He writes with authority when Moll speaks of poverty as a "frightful spectre."<br>An excellent candidate for classroom use, this classic of 18th-century fiction will entertain and enlighten general readers as well.</p><p>The recent adaptation of <b>Moll Flanders</b> for Masterpiece Theater is a book-lover's dream: the dialogue and scene arrangement are close enough to allow the viewer to follow along in the book. The liberties taken with the tale are few (some years of childhood between the gypsies and the wealthy family are elided; Moll is Moll throughout the tale, rather than Mrs. Betty; Robert becomes Rowland, etc.) and the sets avoid the careless anachronism of the movie version released earlier this year. <p> The breasts, raised skirts, tumbling hair and heavy breathing on the small screen might catch you by surprise if you don't read the book carefully (as might Moll's abandonment of her children on more than one occasion). Unlike his near-contemporary John Cleland (_Fanny Hill_), Defoe was trying to keep out of jail, and so didn't dwell on the details of "correspondence" between Moll and her varied lovers. But on the page and on the screen, Moll comes across quite clearly as a woman who might bend, but refuses to break, and who is intent on having as good a life as she can get. </p><p> E. M. Forster in Aspects of the Novel considers Moll and her creator's art in some detail. While he finds much to criticize in Defoe's ability to plot (where did those last two children go, anyway?), he is as besotted with Moll as I am. Immoral? Sure -- but immortal, and never, ever dull. We hope at least a few of the viewers of the recent adaptation take a couple hours to discover the original, inimitable Moll Flanders.</p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Philadelphia Experiment</h2><p>One day in 1943, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, something happened . . . <br>Suddenly the U.S.S. Eldridge, a fully manned destroyer escort, vanished into a green fog, within seconds appeared in Norfolk, Virginia, and then reappeared in Philadelphia!<br>For over thirty-six years officials have denied this, have denied any experimentation to render matter invisible -- have denied the reality of THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT.<br>If so, why --<br>* were all the men aboard ship who survived discharged as mentally unfit?<br>* did a scientific researcher on the project meet a mysterious death?<br>* were identities hidden, documents lost, and amazing connections between UFO sightings and events in the Bermuda Triangle denied?<br>THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT -- the first full-length documented report on a chilling unsolved mystery that's been discussed for years. Now, official documents and first-hand stories have been revealed. Here is the truth in a report so shattering it is difficult to believe it's NOT fiction.</p><p><b>William Moore</b>&nbsp;is the co-author (with Charles Berlitz) of&nbsp;<i>The Philadelphia Experiment</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Roswell Incident</i>.<br><br><b>Charles Berlitz</b>, the author of <i>The Bermuda Triangle, </i>was a renowned linguist, lecturer, and underwater explorer.

He died in 2003.</p><h2>Radical Possibilities: Public Policy, Urban Education, and A New Social Movement (Critical Social Thought)</h2><p><p>The core argument of Jean Anyon&#x2019;s classic <em>Radical Possibilities</em> is deceptively simple: if we do not direct our attention to the ways in which federal and metropolitan policies maintain the poverty that plagues communities in American cities, urban school reform as currently conceived is&nbsp; doomed to fail. With every chapter&nbsp; thoroughly revised and updated, this&nbsp; edition picks up where the 2005 publication left off, including a completely new chapter detailing how three decades of&nbsp; political decisions leading up to the&nbsp; &#x201c;Great Recession&#x201d; produced an&nbsp; economic crisis of epic proportions.&nbsp;&nbsp; By tracing the root causes of the financial crisis, Anyon effectively demonstrates the concrete effects of economic decision-making on the education sector, revealing in particular the disastrous impacts of these policies on black and Latino communities. </p> <p>Going beyond lament, <em>Radical Possibilities</em> offers those interested in a better future for the millions of America&#x2019;s poor families a set of practical and theoretical insights. Expanding on her paradigm for combating educational injustice, Anyon discusses the Occupy Wall Street movement as a recent example of popular resistance in this new edition, set against a larger framework of civil rights history.&nbsp; A ringing call to action, <em>Radical Possibilities</em> reminds readers that throughout U.S. history, equitable public policies have typically been created as a result of the political pressure brought to bear by social movements. Ultimately, Anyon&#x2019;s revelations teach us that the current moment contains its own very real radical possibilities.<br><br></p></p><p><p>Jean Anyon is professor of social and educational policy in the Doctoral Program in Urban Education at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. She is the author of the best-selling and critically acclaimed <em>Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban School Reform</em>.</p><p>"A year after her death, this second edition of Anyon's Radical Possibilities continues to trouble the status quo of American education systems that reinforce hegemonically stratified social structures...Anyon's voice is radical, and needs to be heard in the ongoing debate over where the US is headed...Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduate, graduate, and research collections."- <em>D. D. Bouchard, Crown College, in CHOICE, January 2015</em></p> <p>&#x201c;In this new edition of <em>Radical Possibilities</em>, Anyon makes it clear that the real obstacles to change in urban schools are not lazy teachers, unmotivated students or disengaged parents.&nbsp; Rather, the roots of the problems confronting urban schools lie in an economic system that perpetuates gross inequality and protects the powerful at the expense of the poor.&nbsp; She also reminds us that the system can and has been challenged through collective agency and organized resistance.&nbsp; It is a message of pragmatic optimism that will inform, empower and inspire readers.&#x201d;&#x2015;Pedro Noguera, Professor of Education, New York University</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a hopeful book for cynical times, a call to action rather than reaction, a call for change that helps the 99% rather than enriches the 1%. Jean Anyon asks us to envision a more equitable future so we can start to create it.&#x201d;&#x2015;William G. Tierney, University Professor and Wilbur-Kieffer Professor, University of Southern California</p> <p>&#x201c;For over three decades, Jean Anyon has been one of the English speaking world's most powerful intellectuals on the subject of education, and this revised edition solidifies her legacy. The volume is a &#x2018;must read&#x2019; for anyone who works to understand and challenge the seemingly intractable relationship between race, class, schooling, and social and economic inequalities in the 21st century.&#x201d;&#x2015;Lois Weis, State University of New York Distinguished Professor, University at Buffalo</p></p><h2>The Plaid Avenger&#39;s World: A Populist Apocalypse Edition</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The most easily-digestable and entertaining world regions textbook. Adopted by over 20 universities and schools around the country.</strong></p><p>Get on board now as this 21st century train is leaving the station! This is the newest in new, the coolest in cool, most engaging textbook for the future generations of Americans as yet untaught in the basics of world geography, world history, international relations and current events. <strong><em>The Plaid Avenger&#x2019;s World</em></strong> is an introduction to the world, the whole world, and nothing but the world...which includes a little bit of everything.<br><br> It can be employed in courses like World Regional Geography, Intro to the Modern World, 20th Century History, 21st Century Happenings, Global Politics, and/or Global Literacy in general. The primary goal of this textbook is to essentially &#x2018;catch up&#x2019; our woefully internationally-clueless students to the who/what/when/where/why arena of global events...in essence, to give them a framework of understanding into the critical and complex issues of our time that are now occurring in a global context.<br><br> That&#x2019;s right! There&#x2019;s that nefarious word &#x2018;global&#x2019;! It seems to be everything nowadays...but for good reason. The world has changed rapidly in the last few decades, becoming ever more irrevocably interconnected than ever before. Like it or not, economies, politics, health/safety/environmental issues, and even cultures from across the planet are increasingly affecting each other every day and in every way. We now live in a global community....but most students know nothing of their neighbors! This international ignorance must end, and soon, as the success of our future generations-- and the great USA itself--depend on a literate, confident, and comprehending population that is not just aware of the world, but is engaged in it. But how can we immerse and interest an American population long-trained to be self-absorbed and globally disengaged? Enter: the Plaid Avenger.<br><br> A meek and mild-mannered college professor by day, by night the Plaid Avenger roams the planet by night to fight international injustices and solve instances of international intrigue....and explain it to students across the nation, in serious plaid fashion too! More importantly, he has written this textbook (<strong><em>The Plaid Avenger&#x2019;s World</em></strong>) as a titanic tool for international enlightenment, but with a twist: the narrative is presented in first person, straight from the Avenger&#x2019;s mouth, in the vernacular of the street, with gritty detail that students seem to relish. Forget the arcane and abstract academic treatises. This is a real dude, telling the real deal, to real students. It&#x2019;s real! Yes! It does all that, and a whole lot more. It&#x2019;s really a novel novel!<br><br> Why else so novel and new and a revolutionary concept? Because it is a book that continues to be written every day! Say what? The textbook has all the basics and backgrounds of the major regions of the planet which can be used for weekly readings and discussion. However, the Plaid Avenger him- self appears on a video blog on-line 2-3 times weekly to explain and elaborate on current events as they are unfolding! Have your students tune in and get turned on to what is actually happening out in the real world, as the man in plaid makes the connections from the page to the planet.<br><br> Additional web resources such as World Leaders Profiles, an on-line current event Comic Book<br><br> Adventure, International Interviews, interactive student forums, and Plaid Avenger Film Reviews have been developed for, and with input from, actual high school and college students....just as the original textbook was developed too. It is a product of the peoples! As such, you and your students have a voice in future topics as well: all Plaid Avenger current events missions and website content is based on user requests from you! Want an explanation on a hot topic or to see an additional world leader of note? Just drop a line to the Avenger and it will happen!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Sidewalk Oracles: Playing with Signs, Symbols, and Synchronicity in Everyday Life</h2><p><b>Become a Kairomancer</b> Synchronicity is when the universe gets personal.

In <i>A World More Concrete</i>, N. D. B. Connolly uses the history of South Florida to unearth an older and far more complex story. Connolly captures nearly eighty years of political and land transactions to reveal how real estate and redevelopment created and preserved metropolitan growth and racial peace under white supremacy. Using a materialist approach, he offers a long view of capitalism and the color line, following much of the money that made land taking and Jim Crow segregation profitable and preferred approaches to governing cities throughout the twentieth century.<br> <br> <i>A World More Concrete</i> argues that black and white landlords, entrepreneurs, and even liberal community leaders used tenements and repeated land dispossession to take advantage of the poor and generate remarkable wealth. Through a political culture built on real estate, South Florida&#x2019;s landlords and homeowners advanced property rights and white property rights, especially, at the expense of more inclusive visions of equality. For black people and many of their white allies, uses of eminent domain helped to harden class and color lines. Yet, for many reformers, confiscating certain kinds of real estate through eminent domain also promised to help improve housing conditions, to undermine the neighborhood influence of powerful slumlords, and to open new opportunities for suburban life for black Floridians.<br> <br> Concerned more with winners and losers than with heroes and villains, <i>A World More Concrete</i> offers a sober assessment of money and power in Jim Crow America. It shows how negotiations between powerful real estate interests on both sides of the color line gave racial segregation a remarkable capacity to evolve, revealing property owners&#x2019; power to reshape American cities in ways that can still be seen and felt today.</p></p><p><b>N. D. B. Connolly</b> is the Hebert Baxter Adams Associate Professor of History at Johns Hopkins University and visiting associate professor of history and social and cultural analysis at New York University.&#x201c;In this bold and brilliant book, Connolly demolishes the conventional wisdom about the relationship of race and place in modern America. &nbsp;Rejecting a narrative that pits the black struggle for civil rights against a white defense of property rights, he shows how&#x2014;and why&#x2014;some African Americans embraced the logic and laws of real estate for their own ends. &nbsp;Deeply researched and elegantly written,&nbsp;<i>A World More Concrete&nbsp;</i>does more than simply describe the landscape created by whites and blacks in a major city; it shows how contemporary America itself was constructed.&#x201d;<br> (Kevin M. Kruse, author of White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism)<br><br><i>&#x201c;A World More Concrete</i>&nbsp;explodes easy assumptions about the relationship between property-holding and white political domination in segregated South Florida. &nbsp;Revealing the tangled connections between black and white landlords and their African American renters, Connolly argues that together, black and white landlords helped ensure Jim Crow's profitability, and its survival within state and society. &nbsp;His unsentimental&nbsp;conclusion that &#x2018;people of every complexion made Jim Crow work&#x2019; will provoke spirited debate among anyone interested in African American history, racial justice, and the quest for equality in America.&#x201d; (Jane Dailey, author of The Age of Jim Crow)<br><br><i>&#x201c;A World More Concrete </i>marks the arrival of an exciting new voice in American political and social history. Through a fascinating history of Miami, Connolly brings together politics, culture, and economics in a riveting account of how shared understandings of property rights and real estate were central to the racial segregation that has plagued America&#x2019;s cities. Connolly unpacks the complex dynamics of property transactions and urban development, meticulously analyzing all the various institutional actors who shape this market in order to understand the political economy of racism.&#x201d; (Julian E. Zelizer <i>Princeton University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There are no heroes in Connolly&#x2019;s <i>A World More Concrete</i> except, perhaps, the long-suffering black masses. There are winners and losers, however, and the big winners were whites who controlled the land and real estate in Miami and Southeast Florida.&#x201d; (<i>Florida Times-Union</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Connolly&#x2019;s sophisticated interpretation highlights ruthless white exploitation and black middle-class complicity alike, identifying entrepreneurs, landlords, elected officials, and self-styled reformers as eager participants in land control schemes that took advantage of the poor. His unsparing narrative shows how native-born whites and blacks, Cubans, Seminoles, Haitians, and other Caribbean groups all invested in segregation. . . . As these cases and a host of others make clear, the author tells us, the story of Jim Crow in South Florida turns out to be a complicated one in which few clear-cut heroes and villains emerge. Capitalism and the profit motive underwrote urban governance, preserved Jim Crow, and put real estate at the center of race relations&#x2014;in Miami and throughout American society. The author&#x2019;s fascinating account will force planners and urban historians to challenge many of their ideas about race and cities.&#x201d; (<i>Planning Perspectives</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Connolly writes with a passion that is born of systematic and comprehensive research and in a voice that though colored with compassion and self-proclaimed &#x2018;irreverence,&#x2019; is not tainted by bias.&#x201d; (<i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;At a time when the long-term consequences of both Jim Crow and urban renewal are still painfully evident across the United States&#x2019; urban landscape, studies such as <i>A World More Concrete</i> help understand how the contemporary structures of white supremacy and power came into being in the first place. Throughout Connolly&#x2019;s work, it becomes very evident that urban planning decisions do not only change the physical structure and outlook of the city (in this case Miami) but also the way in which spaces can be and are inhabited and used in the everyday sense of the term. . . . This study provides plentiful new insights into the intersections of race and place in twentieth-century Miami, but also points far beyond that. The rejection of established ideas of this intersection will certainly lead to new readings of the workings of Jim Crow in the United States at large.&#x201d; (<i>American Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Just when scholars of the twentieth-century United States might reasonably assume we know plenty about how residential segregation in the North and South, in cities and suburbs, was created and defended, Connolly has shown us in this complex, multilayered, and engagingly written work that there is still more to learn about that story. . . . Connolly has a flair for language, metaphor, and character development that propels the narrative and renders it continually engaging. From those kids under the bridge to conflicting eulogies upon the death of Luther Brooks, the most prominent white property manager in the slums, Connolly draws out the contradictions that augment our understanding of how people built housing segregation and its impact. His <i>A World More Concrete</i> is a significant contribution to modern U.S. urban history and the history of race relations.&#x201d;<br> (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>A World More Concrete </i>is a dense, packed tale that expands the historiography on urban racial segregation by embedding it in the history of capitalism. Connolly sharpens our understanding of the close and mutually constitutive relationships among liberalism, capitalism, and racism by placing real estate at the center of all three. Conflicts over the value of land shaped the American city in ways that policy reforms, social movements, and legal arguments could not undo. At times the density of detail somewhat obscures the larger arguments at the heart of the book. But if big points sometimes get buried in details, those details are consistently illuminating: Connolly uncovers an amazing array of perverse creativity, opportunistic alliances, and deceptive actions that shaped modern Miami.&#x201d; (<i>Building &amp; Landscapes</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Connolly&#x2019;s focus on the enduring power of the social and property relationships at the heart of Jim Crow sheds new light on the unfulfilled economic promises of the civil rights movement.&nbsp;<i>A World More Concrete</i> demands we re-periodize the long history of the black freedom struggle along different axes of struggle and provides a compelling measure of its success and shortcomings.&#x201d; (<i>Labor</i>)</p><h2>The Scientific Angler</h2><p>Discusses the behavior of fish, examines which materials attract or repel fish, and offers tips on fishing techniques</p><p></p><h2>Political Ecology: A Critical Introduction, 2nd Edition (Critical Introductions to Geography)</h2><p>This fully updated new edition introduces the core concepts, central thinkers, and major works of the burgeoning field of political ecology. <ul> <li>Explores the key arguments and contemporary explanatory challenges facing the sub-discipline</li> <li>Provides the first full history of the development of political ecology over the last century and its theoretical underpinnings</li> <li>Considers the major challenges facing the field now and for the future</li> <li>Study boxes introduce key figures in the development of the discipline and summarize their most important works</li> <li>Fully updated to include recent events, such as the Gulf&nbsp;of Mexico&nbsp;Oil Spill, as well as both urban and rural examples, from the developed and underdeveloped world</li> </ul></p><p>Political ecology is a field that seeks to make sustainable outcomes more possible and imaginable, but also to critique and undermine the foundations of environmental injustice and destruction - from the wetland shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the forests of India to the slums of Tijuana and the suburbs of Arizona. <p>Written in clear and straightforward language and fully updated in the light of recent events, this new edition of <i>Political Ecology</i> presents the core concepts, central thinkers, and key works of a fast-growing and highly eclectic field.

Plutarch sought to explore the characters and personalities of great men, to see how individual natures led ultimately to tragedy or victory. This selection from Plutarch's massive work profiles five Greeks and five Romans. The translation used here is by an unknown writer, but was associated with John Dryden's name because it was originally published in 1683-1686, in conjunction with a life of Plutarch by Dryden. In 1864, it was revised by the poet and scholar Arthur Hugh Clough, whose introduction and notes are also featured.<br>The great men profiled here include Solon, the lawmaker of Athens, who fostered the growth of the city's democratic institutions; Pericles, whose legendary eloquence was epitomized by his well-known funeral oration; and Alexander the Great, whose incredible eleven-year journey of conquest extended from his native Macedonia to Egypt and India. Among the Romans are the warrior-statesman Marius, who opposed the ruling aristocracy and opened the army to commoners; Cicero, the famous orator; and Julius Caesar, whose extensive character sketch provided Shakespeare with the material for one of his greatest plays.</p><p></p><h2>The Moonstone (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><br><strong>Who, in the name of wonder, had taken the Moonstone out of Miss Rachel's drawer?</strong><br><br>One of the great triumphs of nineteenth-century sensation fiction, <em>The Moonstone</em> tells of a mystery that for page after page becomes more not less inexplicable.

A dramatist as well as a novelist, Collins gives to each of his narrators--a household servant, for instance, a detective, a lawyer, a cloth-eared Evangelical, a dying medical man--vibrant identities as they separately tell the part of the story that concerns themselves. Collins's novel of addictions is itself addictive, moving through a sequence of startling revelations towards the final disclosure of the truth. Entranced with double lives and with men and women who only know part of the story, <em>The Moonstone</em> is also a text that also grows imaginatively out of the secrets that the unconventional Collins was obliged to keep as he wrote the novel.<br></p><p><br><strong>Wilkie Collins</strong><br><br><strong>Francis O'Gorman</strong> is Saintsbury Professor of English Literature at the University of Edinburgh.

(The Editors <i>Lambda Literary</i>)<br><br>What claims our attention is not so much Gober's quotidian subjects as the intentness with which he reconstitutes ordinary objects; this is his way of possessing them. Gober's laconic perfectionism lends humdrum stuff an eeriness. I feel that eeriness in teh subtle shadow play he reveals in his plainly carpentered cloest, in the delicacy of human hairs inserted into the wax surface of a sculpted leg, and in the trompe l'oeil finesse with which he paints the label on the battered Benjamin Moore can. Gober keeps his virtuosity tamped down adn under wraps. His weird world is constructed with teh meticulousness of a jeweler putting together a Faberge egg. (Jed Perl <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>In the mid-1980's Robert Gober began to receive significant art-world attention for his sculptres of everyday domestic objects embedded with references to social justice, freedom adn tolerance. The oblique works offers a socio-political and psyhcological end-of-the-twentieth-century context to their mundane formal structures.

Readers learn the infrastructure is a system of interrelated physical components, and how those components affect, and are affected by, society, politics, economics, and the environment. Studying infrastructure allows educators and students to develop a valuable link between fundamental knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge, so students may translate their knowledge to new contexts.</p> <p>The authors' implementation of modern learning pedagogy (learning objectives, concrete examples and cases, and hundreds of photos and illustrations), and chapters that map well to the ABET accreditation requirements AND the ASCE Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge 2nd&nbsp; edition (with recommendations for using this text in a 1, 2, or 3 hour course) make this text a key part of any civil and/or environmental engineering curriculum.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michael R.
